Here's the Written Review!
Can you hear me screaming?As expected, the illustrations brought this book toa whole new level.I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart andframe it.Each page is just bursting with new life.Honestly, how could younotlove such beautiful images?Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit ofan odd child- much to his family's dismay.Things just...happened...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him anda whole new world opensin front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are thesefull-color, high quality imagesbut there are somanyof them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There'spages and pages of pictureslike this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...Istrongly urgeyou to check out this book.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads

I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love? In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: ""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It ""ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport."" There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all. Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better. Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione. Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling. Go ahead, I dare you. Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid. Quite frankly-this book is amazing.

One of my first jobs was at a bookstore. When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.

Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn't get along with people very well. She wasn't an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese's Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter. Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14. There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The end.Or rather, the beginning.

Yes, yes, I know...this is akin to reader sacrilege.But I just had no interest in these books when they came out. I was too busy reading about men in kilts fucking the milkmaid. Therefore, my only experience with ""Hermione"" is the SNL skit where Lindsey Lohan shows Harry and that other scarfed dude her ginormous tatas.   Well, what with everyone going ape shit over the newest installment, I figure I should probably find out what all this Hogwart's business is about. And since my friend's 9 year old demanded that I read his copy, I now have the paperback in my possession. Hoping to get starting this week...

Third Re-read of the series, and this time I read the illustrated edition, which was pure magic.

It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There’s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won’t find elsewhere. I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I’ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I’m really excited to experience the story “first hand” and see what all was left out from the films. I’m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story. Not sure if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before, but I loved it! Buddy read with Sam of Clues and Reviews!

I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters. It felt like such an abrupt way to end the story... but TBH, I was glad to be done with it so I could move on to other books lol.

Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel, The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate..Let's have,
A Brief !! History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------
Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens, not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo… Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie -what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?- , also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There's few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn't a BIG new attractive Reading Experience to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’s Playstation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..
~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~
So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when Joanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it, and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest “Bloomsbury“ agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children's books. - later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..
J . k . Rowling
And in 26 June 1997 , with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
And Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, 'Philosopher's Stone' to be 'Sorcerer's Stone', as the American publisher feared 'Philosopher's' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher's Stone's legend.In 1998 Book Two released in UK , 1999 in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.

And on 8 July 1999, The 
First Breaking Record
 made when Book Three sold 68.000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it's even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the 'Harry Potter books' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into 'Children Books' and 'Adult Books' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple stores as happening theses days, But it was in front of Bookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of... Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn't mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language. And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then, but that's not our subject now. 
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even in Egypt English edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.

The good news is, the literary movement didn't stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there's more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By 2002 ,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And in April 2003 Dan Brown (previously published 3 novels, making good sales) released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records, The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is 'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later, May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel, The Kate Runner  which also made a very good records too. -Don't you agree if there's no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He'd be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)- And all that didn't affect the main reason for this new 'Literal Renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On 20 June 2003 book Five 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they've been waiting for at least 2 years. Shipping agents like FedEx made the delivery to many countries to get the book at the same time.A New world Record ,5 millions copy at the first day only..For the first time in France a non french language book placed in no.1 of the bestselling book....Some kids got a headache called 'Harry Potter Headache' as they read the whole 850 pages of the book five, the biggest so far, at the same day without resting.And in Egypt, September the same year, the Arabic edition of book three comes out with unexpected sales records, first edition run out of the stores by the first week only, though it's nearly the beginning of the School year, and the movie of this 3rd book still filming. ِAnd the price of it get higher 20% in 2 days and still with increasing demand..More English books and novels sold in Egypt too, along with the Arabic ones, publishing more books for new Egyptian authors and writers along with more of the famous ones, Alaa El Aswany's debut Novel 'Yaqubean's Building' making a very good selling numbers..

And in  July 2004 the Arabic edition of Book Four makes a price war between book stores and magazines stands.January 2005 , an abridged translated edition of Book Five make many readers angry in Egypt , specially that many already read the English edition before, so the publisher release an unabridged one by May.
~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
And on 21 July 2005, A Higher Record that breaks all the previously ones

 6.9 million copy of Book Six sold in US in its first day only...A huge book, it may not be as the fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, Professor Snape. That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months..With Pre-Final Book of Harry Potter is out, it followed by a massive variety of New Novels, New Series, New Authors..Twilight series, Percy Jackson series, and much more, more Books Sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..More Novels hit the top sales..A Real Prosperity.But still Harry Potter is the Records Big Breaker...At the midnight before 21 June 2007, Everywhere around the Globe, the scene of thousands of people lining in front of Book Stores was repeated...even Bigger than any time before..A Huge Record for Pre-Orders online reach to One Million copies by Amazon only, and total sales of 11 millions copies in UK and US in the first day only.The book sold at the Same Day almost in Every Single Country..even in Israel which made a big religious fuss because the Book Stores opened to receive and sell the book at the releasing day which was their holy Saturday, But it's Harry Potter after all, the world's most unusual, unexpected phenomenon and sales records breaker.And that's not bad, it was the Miracle of bringing back readers to Book Stores...And it's not just Harry Potter...Now, that 
'All was well.'
 , thousands of topics went online asking 'what to read next'....Indeed, although there's the e-books, e-readers..etc, still there's thousands of new books and novels published and sold every year , in every where in the world.The gaming devices is increasing? yes, But not as expected though by the 90s and early 2000s 'remember Nokia N-Gage?'.. but so does the reading devices which first come out by Sony in 2004,make big step by Amazon's Kindle in 2007...the ebook applications on every device.New books and series come after that, and still on, making super sales, attracting more readers... more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant. in UK, US , Egypt ..everywhere all over the globe..No matter a Playstation 4 is out, or new Xbox, the Books still there...with its most beloved magic..

“This boy will be famous. There won’t be a child in our world who doesn’t know his name”
That's what Rowling wrote at the very early pages of her first book.. The one that rejected by 12 Publishing Houses in 1996..Well, what about now?God, Talked too much in the ""Brief"" introduction , didn't I?Well, that's it for this review... I guess some still think it's just the Propaganda that made that all....Well I'll try to prove them wrong by the upcoming next 6 reviews at the other 6 Books of the series..Links will be here as soon as it'd done ..But for The First one... sorry to add one more , but 20000 characters aren't enough.The Ultimate Review of Book OneNow I'll be back to go around Hogwarts...

Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot. She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters...) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren't stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it's all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing. I will report back on book 2 when we're done.EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:>>Aliyah wrote: ""Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular."">My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974. Followed by A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) which also centres on a magic school and which I read in 1975.The mechanics of reaching a boarding school on a dedicated train laid on for the purpose and of sorting a boarding school into four groups to be housed in four towers was something I encountered at a still younger age in the early 70s in my mother's copy of First Term at Malory Towers (1946).

So here it is again, may it stick around this time! ”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”Okay, here’s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it’s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol* So I decided to make this a short “my thoughts about this book” review. ;-P1.)	”Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.” I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him. 2.)	”Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry – yer a wizard.”Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD3.)	”Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” “Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)4.)	”Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.”When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I’m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol* 5.)	”You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I’ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he’s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs* 6.)	”Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”And here comes another character I’ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he’s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn’t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry’s father. Well done! ;-)7.)	”But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”I still love that scene and I’m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don’t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don’t get caught anymore. Haha! 8.)	”All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He’s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant! 9.)	”If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It’s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!”I LOVE HARRY’S DEFIANCE!!! That’s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he’s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he’s going to be a great MC! And now let’s move on and read book two! ;-)

On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me, Number 14,577 is that they gave me, at 41 years old, the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series. When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn’t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I’d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it. However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I’ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. It’s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn’t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry’s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity’s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he’s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He’s someone you can’t help but like. He’s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he’s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. But that’s not Harry. He’s a better person than that. That’s why we love him. Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let’s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. I’ll certainly settle for that. As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I’m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don’t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended.

❝This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.❞
Everyone grew up with Harry Potter. They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me. I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.
There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
Harry Potter is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names. Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful ""family"", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister. The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really. The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don't.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know. He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too. He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on. He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like ""we get it."" Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this ""You-Know-Who"" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.
Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.
Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, ""Why did I not read this earlier?"" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young. PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say. It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring. It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness'. I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I've never watched the films. I've watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won't skip anything. It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end. Ron is honestly the cutest. I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I'm sure. I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes. The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it's no surprise. 
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard.

How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?I have to get this right. As of this writing, I have 98 Goodreads friends. 61 (62%) of them have read J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Out of those who read this, 39 (64%) rated this with 5 stars. 11 of them with 4 stars. All the others gave 3 or 2. Only 2 rated this with 1 star. One of them admitted not being able to finish it. She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: 
I will never read Harry Potter
.My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.These are what some of them say: it was a great book i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself.  Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.  Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.  I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.  Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards. Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book. I told you so! Why waste your time? . However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K. Rowling has it!My 39 friends are indeed right!

Can 35 Million Book Buyers Be Wrong? Yes.Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown's School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown's School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)----------------------------The first half of a little piece I wrote from the Journal in July 2000. Rest is available at [http://wrt-brooke.syr.edu/courses/205...].

A world where even the most complicated topics, such as the death, are treated with delicate gentleness. «After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure» words of Albus Dumbledore, the master of life and the most charismatic character of the universe created by Rowling.

Rowling catapulta il lettore in un mondo fantastico, popolato da maghi e scope volanti, unicorni e cappelli parlanti. Un mondo dove perfino i temi più complicati come la morte vengono trattati con delicata leggerezza. «In fin dei conti, per una mente ben organizzata, la morte non è che una nuova, grande avventura» ci dice Silente, il maestro di vita, la figura più carismatica dell'universo creato dalla Rowling. Un universo dove la sfortuna più grande è quella di essere un non magico, un triste ""babbano"" che non sarà mai in grado di vedere il binario nove e tre quarti.Lasciatemi sognare.Voto: 10

So buckle up- it’s bound to be a fun ride (for me… anyway…. cause I’m driving 🤣😂). Seriously… get out now if you’re not up for this adventure…. O…. K….. okay…. let’s go!!! 📚🎧🎬📚Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived What an introduction. I’m already so excited to be re-reading this series. We’ve been introduced to The Dursley’s, Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid. Short re-cap: Poor one year old Harry has lost his parents thanks to “he-who-must-not-be-named” and is being dropped off to live with “muggles” (aka non-magic-folk aka his Aunt and Uncle and cousin aka The Dursley’s) because he’ll be too known/famous in the wizard world and it’s deemed the safest place for him. 📚Chapter 2: The Vanishing GlassUghhhhhh…. Dudley… that is the perfect name for Harry’s Dud of a cousin. This kid is the definition of spoiled brat. Short re-cap: It’s Dudley’s birthday and they take a trip to the zoo. Harry realizes he can understand a snake talking and accidentally makes the glass in the enclosure disappear. 📚Chapter 3: The Letters From No OneCan you imagine having your bedroom be a cupboard under the stairs? The Dursley’s really are crap muggles. Short re-cap: Mysterious letters start to arrive for Harry, addressed very specifically (ex: the cupboard under the stairs). Uncle Vernon refuses to let Harry read any of them, at all costs.📚Chapter 4: The Keeper of the KeysHagrid is simply the best! This gentle giant is one of the greatest characters of all time. Short re-cap: Hagrid tracks down Harry to hand deliver his letter (acceptance to Hogwarts) along with a birthday cake. He’s furious to find that Harry has no idea he’s a wizard. He puts the Dursley’s in their place and changes Harry’s life as he knew it.📚Chapter 5: Diagon AllyWho better to guard money than Goblins? I love the descriptions of Diagon Ally and all the magical shops. Short re-cap: Hagrid takes Harry shopping for school supplies. Harry meets snooty-to-do Draco Malfoy for the first time. 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***This is so spot on. I feel like I just discussed the world with my besties. They make so many valid points and I found myself saying “Yes!!” and “I know, right?!” in agreement with all they have to say. Soooo entertaining and worth the listen! 📚Chapter 6: The Journey from Platform 9 and 3/4The Hogwarts Express sounds so magically amazing. The thought that went into each detail, even the treats from the cart, so awesome. Short re-cap: Harry learns how to get through the platform for the train, thanks to the Weasley’s (aka the best magical family ever). He meets his new BFF Ron and the super-smart Hermione.📚Chapter 7: The Sorting HatEntering the dining hall with its enchanted ceiling and delicious foods would be incredible to anyone. But to a boy who has had little to nothing, it’d be astonishing. Short re-cap: The students are sorted into one of four houses- Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Harry is pleased to be selected for Gryffindor, and not Slytherin (the house bad wizards tend to come from aka Volda… I mean… he-who-must-not-be-named).📚Chapter 8: The Potions MasterSnape is such a jerk to Harry. Malfoy sucks too! Short re-cap: First potions class and Professor Snape seems to have it out for Harry. Harry and Ron have tea with Hagrid. Gringrotts bank was broken into. The vault hit happens to be the one and same that Hagrid took a small package from.📚Chapter 9: The Midnight DuelQuidditch!! The confusingly dangerous, yet, entertaining game. Another detailed thing added to this intricate world. Short re-cap: Harry gets selected as “seeker” for the Gryffindor team. Malfoy tricks Harry into sneaking out at night for a duel. He, Ron, Hermione and Neville find themselves in the forbidden area of the castle, where there is a three headed dog standing on a trapdoor.📚Chapter 10: Halloween A mountain troll fight will solidify any friendship. This duo just became a trio and I love it!! Short re-cap: Ron insults Hermione, who hides in the girls room to cry. A mountain troll breaks into the castle, Ron and Harry realize Hermione may be in danger and find her cowering from the troll. 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***Oh my, this is funny- adult humor funny! They are on point!! That sorting hat, man, oh man- it’s definitely a key part of the story. It is indeed funny, knowing who they end up with, to hear their first impressions of each other.📚Chapter 11: Quidditch Hagrid really is the sweetest and loyalist, but man, he lets things slip, lol. At this point Snape really is terrible. Short re-cap: Harry’s first Quidditch game and his broom gets bewitched. It appears to be Snape’s doing. After winning the game, Harry tells Hagrid that he thinks the three headed dog bit Snape and Hagrid let’s it slip that it’s his dog Fluffy, protecting something for Dumbledore.📚Chapter 12: The Mirror of ErisedI love the Weasleys! It’s Christmas break and they truly treat Harry like part of the family, something he’s never had before. Short re-cap: Harry receives an invisibility cloak for Christmas, that belonged to his father. He sneaks out one night and finds a mirror that allows him to see his parents.📚Chapter 13: Nicolas FlamelQuidditch is Harry’s opportunity to be more than just ‘the boy who lived’. Short re-cap: Harry wins another match. The trio figure out that what the Sorcerers Stone is. Harry overhears Snape speaking with Professor Quirrell about the stone.📚Chapter 14: Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback Oh, Hagrid!! He loves creatures, like dragons, and tends to get himself into trouble over them. Short re-cap: Hagrid gets a dragon egg, which is illegal. The trio help him get the dragon to safety via Ron’s brother. As they head back to the tower they get caught sneaking back in.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-14***Warning: podcast has adult content***I love the reminders of all the hidden gems- that all come to fruition as the story progresses and ends. I also appreciate the humor with Neville and Hagrid…. Hilarious!!📚Chapter 15: The Forbidden ForestUnicorn blood…. Ewwwww…. Poor Harry goes from most loved to most hated Gryffindor in one night! Short re-cap: Harry gets detention for sneaking out and lost a ton of points for Gryffindor. His punishment is helping Hagrid track a wounded unicorn.

Short re-cap: Harry discovers Quirrell, not Snape, is after the stone. Voldemort is unable to touch Harry, who uses this to his advantage. Dumbledore arrives in time to save Harry and the stone. 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 15-17***Warning: podcast has adult content***My goodness, this is a great podcast. They point out the hidden messages, the faults, the ridiculous, the marvelous…. I can’t stress this enough- this podcast contains adult content, language, innuendos, spoilers- so use digression before diving in.🎬Movie #1I greatly appreciate all the visual elements of this world coming to life in a movie. From the moment Hagrid bangs down the door to pick up Harry, you’re fully immersed in this magical world. But I’ll still always say, the books are better than the movies. Because, they are! It’s semi disappointing that Neville is missing so much from the film, cause he’s really a great character.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***I loved this episode. They really hit the nail on the head. From the bits that were missing, to the bits that were added. It’s refreshing to have these two put into words what true potter fans have observed.This, my friends, wraps up my revisit of The Sorcerers Stone. I’m so glad that I decided to go back and re-read the books. This added element of podcast and movie, has made it that much more entertaining.

But I was actually a pretty happy kid. Go figure. Harry Potter #1 was a GOOD book. It was fascinating, it was adventurous, it was different, and it was also average.Now, I don’t mean average in a bad way, I mean that there was nothing in the book that made me gasp or cry or shout out in frustration or anticipation. It was a good book, nothing more nothing less.(s) I just want to say !! ALL OF YOUR JUDGEMENT IS CLOUDED by your nostalgia !! – there I said it, bye. Everyone read this book as a kid, and yes that’s AWESOME im soooooooo happy for you and that you get to experience your childhood all over again with rereads. However comma as a person who’s reading this book with purely unbiased (im giving myself too much credit here) eyes, I have come to the professional conclusion that this book will not IN FACT knock your woolen socks off. But it’s definitely fun to read. The writing is clear, it’s easy to binge, its short and to the point without over-wordy prose. The plot was interesting. The characters were fun (thought Harry Potter is suffering from a serious case of Special Snowflake Syndrome). So yes, it was a nice read. But so were many other books I read this year and this one definitely didn’t instill some newfound love in my soul for magic and wizards and woolen socks – I already have enough there, initially. (s) I’m just fricken glad I’m starting to get all the references all you muggles throw around all the time. Don’t worry, I will most definitely be continuing with this series. :))) “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.” 3 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~YES, YOU READ THAT RIGHT. I'M FINALLY STARTING THIS SERIES AFTER YEARS OF IGNORANCE. (more like I've been bullied into this)but hey, now I'll know what the colourful hat sorting names mean. :))) Buddy read with the wonderful, Lacy and Peer Pressure

It´s never too late to get back to magic school, even if one is just a dirty muggle.Quite a while ago (I was young, so young, omg, what happened, where is all the time, how could this hopeful young boy become such a demoni…), sorry, typo; I read this thing and now I thought that a reread might be an extremely interesting experience, especially regarding my obsession of vivisecting literature with the help of the almighty tvtropes. But there is a problem.I have a massive deficit of reading all kinds of fantasy because the series take such huge amounts of time, there is a hyperinflation of YA and high fantasy and I am more into sci-fi, humor, and horror, so I can´t really compare it with other, similar kids and YA fantasy literature. But I can just cherrypick any weird thought, Frankenstein it together, mwuahahaha call it a review, post it, run, and hope that nobody notices. I should have put this to the end of the review…It would be really interesting to know which elements were already there, maybe even in similar constellations, and which were Rowlings´ own, unique inventions. The underdog group of friends, the systems of magic, the only sure thing and constant in fantasy might be the big bad evil lurking in the background while the sockpuppet antagonistic humans prepare the final war. More comparisons could be interesting in the other direction, the future, my obsession, too because there might have been the one or other opportunistic genre swifts, series, subgenres heavily influenced by Harry that are now beginning to collide with newer hypes and trends. Quite a freaking amazing evolution.I am not sure if a man could have written a similar piece, because there are, gosh, gender differences. Yes, I just dissed and discriminated against my own gender, sue me if you want, I´ve legal expenses insurance so good luck with that, but my perfectly politically incorrect opinion is that there are genres and readers that just perfectly fit together. Or not, and in these cases, different genders, gender identities, etc. are prone to reading and writing gender specific content. Although there may be female hard sci-fi, plot focused writers with minimalistic characterizations and male authors writing soft epic, romantic fantasy, they are exceptions and I don´t deem this diversity something negative. On the contrary, I will just shout out that a man would maybe not have been able to write such a compelling book and that Potter could have failed, or at least not have had such immense success, without the feminine touch. Now I´ll be roasted, trolled, and hunted down, but that was totally worth it. Stupid haters, get a life. I should really consider reducing the offending the audience level.Rowling did an immensely good job in using Sandersons´laws of magic to make anything interconnected and somewhat even linking character traits to certain kinds of magic systems, and preferences while aiming at one of the biggest and fangirly/boysest audiences possible, young readers. Many of these won´t have seen similar uses in old, unknown works or still too difficult to enter high fantasy concepts and will be blown away when they first enter this amazing universe. Faith stereotypically and predictably, far less creative and open minded than the young readers, helped in promoting Potter by talking about the danger of magic and such trivial, evil works on kids and children. Really, bigots, did you learn nothing out of 2 millennia of religious wars, witch burning, and genocides? Sigh, as already said, haters gonna hate, but at least this ridiculous attempts of demonizing one of the most pop cultural big bangs of all time helped to make it even more popular. What did they fear, that millions of boys and girls start doing black magic, break quantum dimensional time travel stuff, and unleash the flying spaghetti monster that would ruin their assets?The extreme success of Rowlings´ excessive use of adjectives and breaking many other rules of this, so called, self proclaimed, quality newspaper writing gurus, high brow literature, „I´ll tell anyone to write just with my, only right, recipe, because this is how art has to be done and creativity has to be unleashed under controlled circumstances“ is a good reason for rofling around all day. Seriously, Nobel price, elitist high culture literature trash woman/man? How many people would read your favorite, old and cheap as dirt, garbage if schools and universities wouldn´t buy this ridiculous, bad writing (fueled by nationalism, pride about the big sons (why no sisters?), each nation on earth with its own, terrible, old big prodigies of writing weird, boring, bad concoctions because they were the only freaking, elitist people writing something centuries or decades ago) to torture helpless young people and make them hate reading for the rest of their lives. Close to nobody! And honestly, what´s wrong with you ever so sophisticated literary critics, fine arts professors, and wannabe pseudo intellectuals, looking down at literature that kids love and that´s made for them while promoting the haters troll train that bores them out, steals their time, and makes them functional illiterates? Go, Harry, transform them from the inside out into the slimy, stinky creatures they truly are. That escalated quickly.Looking at a kind of big history picture of the socio cultural impact of one of the most successful fantasy series ever, one could ironically say, that it´s the ultimate, exaggerated interpretation of what could be behind the words, using soft sciences and magics. Maybe doing so is wrong, true, ingenious, stupid, deep, a waste of time, however, how audiences perceive and philosophy about groundbreaking works, by reflecting its impact, is maybe one of the greatest extra joys of reading.One of the coolest magic tricks would be to reactivate the fully immersive flow and flash of reading when young, but I can at least feed on the reminiscences of already quite blurry pictures and sharpen them while rereading one of the most groundbreaking fantasy works ever that helped make hundreds of millions of kids, and the one or other adult, avid readers.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon...

In 2020, I decided to reread the Harry Potter series again with friends in the Retro Chapter Chicks group. As adults we lead busy lives. There are infinite numbers of books published and with this lack of time, we need something magical, especially in the winter months when the sun doesn’t shine as much in the northern hemisphere. My solution to the winter doldrums was revisiting Harry Potter’s magical world even if for some of us like myself it is at least the 20th time reading the series. Magic has a way of brightening one’s day and in any saga you can pick up new intricacies with each read through. The best part will be the discussions afterward but after all these times there is nothing like hearing “You’re a Wizard, Harry”, and there is something magical in hearing those words as I began my reading year on New Year’s Day. I have read Harry Potter more times than I have fingers and toes, and all four of my kids have read the entire series through twice. They have indulged in fan fiction and been sorted into houses on Pottermore. At this point, I have two Slytherins, two Ravenclaws, and my husband who is determined to take test again because he was inadvertently sorted into Hufflepuff. Of course, he claims it’s ok because Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson is supposedly also in Hufflepuff. That is how much Harry Potter has permeated society, to the point where the gulf between the books and fan fiction is at an all time low. Harry Potter was first published in 1998 and has been around my entire adult life. Imagine if it existed when I was my kids’ ages and had the luxury of reading for the first time at age five or six. By this point in my life, I would have the entire series memorized the way I can rattle off lines from the original Star Wars trilogy verbatim. Like Star Wars, Harry Potter is timeless. It was also written by an author who was unsure if it would be successful and initially only submitted the first book to be published. How wrong was J.K. Rowling when it came to betting on herself as more than twenty years later she has created an entire empire out of her franchise. There is something about adolescence that places a child in a gap between childhood and adulthood that makes it a magical time in one’s life. Just yesterday my twelve-year-old daughter noted that she wants to be an adult because she’s too old to be a kid but too young to drive or do adult things. Point taken. What I have always loved about this first installment besides discovering about the magical world for the first time is how young Harry and his friends are. He notes at one point to Ron and Hermoine that Dumbledore gave them the tools to succeed and it was up to them to complete their tasks. Just as in real life an adolescent needs guidance, they are also capable of doing many things on their own, but they are oh so needy. Like Harry was when he didn’t know how to get to platform 9 3/4 or how to mount a broomstick or how any of the first year students still are in need of a helping hand of the prefects to show them the way as they navigate Hogwarts for the first time. Having kids in this age range allows for me to think wow, parents are allowing their eleven year old children to go away for school. They are entrusting others to help raise their children in this big, scary world that we live in. And the children in turn become independent at a younger than usual age, fostering layers upon layers of character development that Rowling employs even from this first book. It is little wonder that I was giddy to get started with the series again. In this 2020 reading I have noticed yet again that Rowling has set the stage for events that will come later on in the series. They can be as mundane as the mention of Nicholas Flamel on the back of a chocolate frog card, or as crucial as Harry noting that Snape appears to be able to read minds. Knowing what we know about Snape and his character development makes me laugh at this line, only because I know of all the adventures that will occur and how Snape is either in the way or foiled by Harry in the end. I also noticed this time around the gulf between love and evil and that Harry’s mother’s love for him is something Voldemort can not understand. The stage is set for the interplays between Harry and Snape and the many iterations of Voldemort here in the first book, and one needs to read carefully so as not to miss anything. Reading this many times, I still managed to gain something new, and I think this time around, my key theme will be the characterization of every character, major and minor, and the nuances in dialogue between various personas. Harry having an aha moment about Hagrid might have been lost to me at age twenty but I get immediately and find myself chuckling a bit at age forty. As the books get longer and darker, these conversations which I once thought were fillers will become all the more important to the development of the plot, and I look forward to reaching them later in the series. I am thankful that I have finally reached a stage where I am captivated by a plethora of books, not just one series like I was as a younger, less experienced reader or when I had little time for hefty books when I had young children in the house. I am glad that J.K. Rowling created this world so that kids can foster a love of reading and become lifelong readers. For that, nineteen years later, I can still turn to Harry in times of need and be grateful that Harry, Ron, and Hermoine will always be there for readers in need of an escape from the vagaries of everyday life. I recently bought the series for myself so I can turn to this ultimate comfort read in times of need and not be reliant upon the library for my copy. Being able to read a whole book in a day or favorite passages is pure magic to say the least. So in 2020 I will be undertaking seven years of magic again. The kids are at a stage when they read from the teen section of the library and I find myself craving children’s books. Needless to say I need some magic in my life as I read about other teenagers and adolescents as a means of escaping the everyday stress that comes with raising kids that age of my own. It should be a fun journey and now that I have book 1 under my belt again, I look forward to spending a good chunk of my 2020 reading year inside of Hogwarts. As always, 5 stars

But here it is, 2015 and I'm trying again! This time I'm doing the wonderful Stephen Fry narration on audio. It's interesting to come into these books after all this history, both in the sense of the cultural impact of these stories as well as the knowledge of how much children's lit, as art and as industry, has changed for the better because of them. Re-read reaction: 3.5 starsWith this first book (and I suspect with the next few), I still feel the way I did before. I admire the incredibly imaginative ideas so much, but the writing isn't quite as rich or the character development isn't quite as deep/emotional as I'd like just yet. It's a pretty straightforward story, albeit one embellished with fantastic details. But I LOVE HERMIONE GRANGER, always have, and I've heard the later books are much darker. And it's still a lovely experience to have the books read to me like a bedtime story. My favorite parts of this book: The mirror of Erised, owl post (pleeease may I have an owl), and the thing hidden under the turban. And:
It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.
Well done, Neville. You deserved the same number of house points as the other children, in my book.

May be it is because the author moves mainly along building characters - which are much quickly understood - instead of building a detailed fantasy world. Unlike in a Tolkien novel, where we are given every minuscule detail of the world, Harry Potter is far more character focused, and has been done amazingly. I never dreamed I'll this fascinated by a children's book. ""There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now that I'm finished with the first book, I cannot help regretting why didn't I read this before. This is far far better than watching the movie - and considering how enjoyable the movies are, that's saying a lot. Definitely going to re-visit this one, many times hopefully. Cannot wait to start reading the next one."" 'Ah, music' he said, wiping his eyes. 'A magic beyond all we do here!' ""

Somehow, I managed to avoid the entire Harry Potter franchise my whole life, a fact I'm not proud of but am very happy about because I got to go into this book knowing absolutely nothing and it was spectacular. I loved every moment of this book, it was fun and magical, and I got utterly lost in the Wizarding World as I learnt all about it alongside Harry. So clever, beautiful plot – this book series is iconic and for such good reason. There’s not much else I could say that hasn’t already been said a million times before. This book series is a classic, and I am honoured to have read it. I am having the best time reading the books, I’ve already moved on to the rest of the series, and I cannot wait to be finished so that I can go back and reread them.

Why? Well, because I'm stupid. I've always told myself that Harry Potter might be something that I won't like, something I won't enjoy. In my head, I kept telling myself that wizards just aren't my thing and all that stupid shit. I honestly don't know why I did that though. But I finally got over my doubt and picked this up and I'm speechless. In a good way of course! It was super good! Next time, for any book series I want to read, I shall never listen to that stupid little voice in my head. I will read anything I want to anytime, anywhere! Especially Harry Potter :) First off, let me talk about Harry Potter. This guy, is fucking amazing. He is one of the few characters I've ever read about that no matter what, stays strong and doesn't let anyone influence him or change his view on things. And that's what I admire most about Harry. If he thinks something isn't right, he sets his mind to it and tries to fix it, regardless of what others say around him. Now me on the other hand, is the complete opposite. I'm the person that cowers behind people and stays quiet. I don't like drawing attention to myself. But Harry really made me see that in certain circumstances, I need to raise my voice and stand up for what I believe is right. Really, I could go on and on, but Harry Potter is just uhhh, I can't even put into words what I'm feeling right now! Next, Ronald Weasley is super adorable! He's funny and well, just Ron. I love his personality and his quirkiness. I wish I had a friend like him. Ron is just that kind of person that can make you laugh or turn a really serious situation into something funny and silly. It's always good to know a person like Ron. Sometimes they come in handy. Also, I fucking suck at chess. I have tried multiple times to play, but I will never understand the rules and strategies of chess. Ron seriously needs to give me a few lessons on how to play chess. Hermione Granger: she knows her facts, studies hard, and is that know-it-all-type-of-girl. At first, I thought she was so bratty. I have to admit, I wasn't really fond of her at first, but as the story progressed, I grew to like her. She's super nice and has Harry and Ron's backs no matter what. Hermione is loyal and just uhhh, again I can't put into words how much I love this girl! Plus, I have her wand. One of my aunts went to ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" in Universal Studios located in Orlando, Florida like, years ago. At the time, I've of of HP but was never really interested in it. And she came back with Hermione's wand, which looks super badass, if you ask me ;) So I'm proud to say that I have some HP merchandise. To add, she also got me a HP bookmark that's a hook and you just hook it to the inside of your book. Hogwarts is so cool! It's scary yet beautiful at the same time! I would go on about each individual character, but that would be too many words and by the time you get there, you'd probably already be asleep xD So I'll just leave it here. About the rest of all the characters in this book, each and everyone of them were wonderful! As well as the plot! And that surprise twist at the end, I never saw coming! Magnificent book and can't wait to start book 2! :) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ I feel so left out on the world Harry Potter and don't have a clue what people are talking about, so I think it's about time I read this baby. And please no spoilers! This is my first time reading the series xoxo :)Super excited!

Second Read Review: 
This is my second time reading this book. I still remember how I enjoyed it very much years ago when I read it for the first time. Like it was so magical and adventurous and I fell in love with the series right away after I finished reading the first book. So I decided to reread it this year because I miss all of the characters, the humor and the adventure. Moreover, this series also changed me.

Second Read Review: 
This is my second time reading this book. I still remember how I enjoyed it very much years ago when I read it for the first time. Like it was so magical and adventurous and I fell in love with the series right away after I finished reading the first book. So I decided to reread it this year because I miss all of the characters, the humor and the adventure. Moreover, this series also changed me. I wouldn't be the woman I am today without this series ( and also along with other books ). I still liked the book, but I just felt like it wasn't as fun as I read it for the first time. When I began rereading this book, I still remembered the story and the events clearly, so that's probably why I didn't enjoy it like I used to. BUT I still liked it. It was fun and great! My favorite scene in this book is when Harry, Hermione and Ron wanted to reach the Philosopher's Stone and then Ron and Harry were some kind of tangled or strangled? By a plant and the thing to save them was something that emanated warmth and suddenly Hermione said that there were no woods and Ron was angry and shouted whether she's a witch or not because she could easily conjure a spell to help them and I guess she forgot that she could do that and I honestly laughed out loud because it's so funny hahaha. Maybe Hermione was still getting used of being a witch 😂 Hermione is one of my top favorite characters along with Ron and Harry. She's just so smart, and such a loyal friend. Overall I enjoyed reading this book. I liked it but not as much as I used to though. But still I liked it. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
First Read Review : 
 5 STARS. this is the hardest review I have ever written because what can I say about Harry Potter?! But I'll try my best on writing this review ;) Harry Potter is an eleven year old boy. He lives with aunt Petunia, uncle Vernon and his naughty cousin, Dudley. Harry's parents were dead when he was a toddler. They were killed. his uncle and aunt and cousin always treat him so badly. Harry even sleeps in a cupboard. But there's something special about him that he doesn't even know it. Until a letter from Hogwarts arrives at his house and a big man named Hagrid tells him that he is a wizard...
My Opinion
don't freak out okay? because this is the first time I read Harry Potter. I know, I know. I'm so late but I think there's no such thing as too late when it comes to books. ;DI read this because everyone that I know always loved this series. My big sister loved this series. My big brother also loved this series ( but he only have watched the movies, because he's not a reader ) and I think all my Goodreads friends also loved this series. So I was like "" what am I waiting for?! I need to order this book"" but the problem is I just bought the first book because I just wanted to try it and I had never thought that I would love this book so much. now I have to wait the next books to arrive at my home. I WAS SO STUPID!! I'm serious, I even cried when I finished this book because :1. (view spoiler)[You know that ending, when Gryffindor wins the house cup. I was about to scream "" GRYFFINDOR. GRYFFINDOR. GRYFFINDOR.!!"" but I realised that me, my mom and my brother were in the same room and if I did that, I'm sure they would think I was crazy. xD. (hide spoiler)] 2. I DON'T HAVE THE SEQUEL!! guys, if you haven't read this book, I suggest you all to read it and don't just buy the first book. unless you want to end up like me.
Why Did I Give This Book 4.9 Stars?
I loved all the characters in this book, Except you, Malfoy. He always mocked Ron and it made me so angry! I mean, how could anyone hate Ron Weasley?! and guys I loved all the weasleys! George and Fred made me laugh so much and Percy! this cute boy who always said ""Prefect"" everytime. I wish I had friends like these guys. oh! and the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was so great! I always thought I was Hermione while reading it hahaha. oh! and Peeves the poltergeist! I liked him so much! he always made me laugh! everytime he caused trouble I always laughed, he is my favorite ghost in this series and I hope I'll see him again in the sequel. guys, did you like him or hate him? and if Peeves isn't your favorite ghost, so who's your favorite ghost? tell me on comment section below!so basically, I loved everything about this book. To be honest, I have watched all the movies before reading the book. I guess I watched them all like... 5 years ago. I wasn't a reader that time. But thankfully I don't really remember about the story but I still do remember the ending. I wish I could forget it. T^T I tried the test on pottermore a few days ago and the result was GRYFFINDOR. I  was  am so happy! what about you guys? thank you guys for reading and liking this review! I hope you guys have an amazing weekend. Happy Reading!! ❤❤❤

“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”
This book was as enchanting as it was to 11 year old me when my sister put Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in my hands and told me I simply have to read this series. Harry Potter meant so much to me as a kid as it did to millions of others. It was a magical world I could fall into and experience Harry's amazing adventures with him. I read them over and over and it took me many years to finally come out of my Harry Potter bubble and realize that there are other books for me to read and love as well. I haven't done a reread since I was 16 so it has been 7 years since I've read any of the HP books. I'm sure you all know how this story goes but bare with me as this will officially be the first time I review this book.Harry Potter lives with his horrible aunt, uncle and cousin (the Dursleys). Forced to sleep in the small room under the staircase, he is reminded everyday of his life that he is nothing more than an ordinary boy and an inconvenience. No matter what the Dursleys say, strange and inexplicable things always seem to happen to and around Harry.And though his uncle and aunt try to stop events from unfolding, one day a giant stranger arrives at their door to finally tell Harry the truth about who he really is and to invite him to attend the prestigious, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But even in the magical world Harry is not ordinary. He is the boy who lived. The boy who the dark sorcerer, Lord Voldemort, failed to kill and who's impossible survival caused Voldemort to vanish.Life at Hogwarts is great, Harry has finally found a place he belongs. But his wonderful life at Hogwarts is disrupted when Harry and friends, Ron and Hermione, stumble upon clues to strange happenings that they simply cannot ignore. Something important is being kept safe at Hogwarts, but our trio know that it won't be safe for long and take it upon themselves to investigate and stop it from falling into evil hands. I was a bit surprised by how short the chapters are and how fast the plot moved. As a kid it seemed so much longer, but I should have expected that now that I am a faster reader. 😂 As I usually do an annual HP movie marathon, the actors faces immediately pop into my head and I cannot help but picturing them during this reread. This is definitely a foundation book, where the rest of the plot will be built upon. But it did not lack excitement and it had the right amount of charm. I like that as you go through the books there is still so much to learn about Hogwarts and the magical world. It honestly would not have been as enchanting if we new everything from the first book. This book is just the beginning of Harry's life at Hogwarts and I am so excited to move through the years with him! ______My reviews for:2:  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban4: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire5: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix6: Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince7: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

The first HP novel is already a classic. I have read it in the original English and the (slightly disappointing IMHO) French translation because my kid, just a few months after starting reading, plunged head first into this book and only resurfaced after the last one. I never made it past the 3td book but admittedly really enjoyed this book. It is the most light-hearted and funny of the series despite the darkness of the One Who Cannot Be Named. The universe created by Rowling is one of the most complete and compelling ones ever for kids - that I will freely admit. I obviously would love to witness a quiddich match and go to a class dealing with mandrakes and eat in that fabulous dining hall. That being said, it seems to be quite a lonely life - the idealisation in a sense of pensions for kids of rich (or in this case) magical families is perhaps a tad disturbing when you want to be a more hands-on parent and these parents apparently have no issue with only seeing their kids on holidays and during the summer. I am not sure I could do that, but that is just me perhaps.An extremely entertaining and memorable tale that my kids both adored in both book and movie form!Just finished reading HP1 aloud to my son in English and found it to be very enjoyable. The plot does stick together, the characters are endearing (I love Ron's little side remarks about Hermione in the beginning), and the imagination Rowling deployed to create this magical universe is astounding. I cannot believe that this first book is already 20 years old! It has really aged well. I cannot really point to any weaknesses at all. It was entertaining and a pure joy to share with my son - his first time through in English! I believe I will set a 2017-2018 goal to finish all 7 books this time around! Finished #2 on audiobook so on to Azkaban now.

Do I even need to list all the reasons why this book was a joy to read? The writing style was easy to read, but wasn't simple or standard. It still had its unique twist to it, which lead to me finally reading one of those books, where you just can't decide what age group it was written for. I genuinely believe that the story would be enjoyed by everyone; whether it's my 10-year-old brother or my grandma (who is about to turn 80) - they all would have a pleasant and joyful reading experience. I also totally did not expect to laugh so much while reading - there's some really dry and wonderful humor in here.Despite this being my first time reading Harry Potter, the story wasn't new to me. I was a huge fan of the first five movies when they were released (but for some reason never bothered to watch the rest?? I don't understand my younger self...). My obsession was quite big for a while, but after the initial enthusiasm had ceased, I never watched any of them again. In retrospect I've got to say that this was a good thing, because I now got more and more excited every time I recognized a name or remembered a scene that came up. If I had to criticize anything, it would be about the length of some of the more intense scenes. I guess they could have done with a bit more build-up. However, that's really just nitpicking, and the main reason for that complaint is my wish for the book to have more pages so I could be staying in this world for a longer duration and finding out more about the (lovely) characters.It also needs to be taken into consideration that this is just the first installment of a series with seven parts. Looking at the length of some of the later books, I'm sure I will get my wish fulfilled in the near future.

“He’ll be famous, a legend, there will be books written about Harry, every child in our world will know his name!”This line was written 1997, in the very 1st chapter of the very 1st book of a series that been rejected by many publishers. But I've talked about that before.So let's see here, with this beautiful Illustrated Edition,chapter by chapter, Reviewing & Analyzing -from my simple reader perspective- of the first Harry Potter book, why this line isn't exaggerating. Why this line came true..Chapter One : THE BOY WHO LIVEDA two sides chapter..First, It starts “Perfectly Normal,Thank You Very Much”. What's supposed to be a normal day for a very normal man, Mr. Dursley..Mind his encounter with a peculiar Cat that won't be “shoo”-ed.(
-Fun Trivia
; that's the only encounter between the 2 stern characters, Mr. Dursley & Professor McGonagall.-)Mind the Owls’ hyperactivity during the day, Mind those weird men in weirdest costumes.(-okay, in case you didn't read it before, it's October 31, 1981, he may didn't mind much because of, you know, it's Halloween day.)Stranger things started as we move to The Other Side, with the arrival of an old Wizard to this Normal street at night.And the Cat is a professor, a huge man in flying motorcycle, and a little boy became an orphan by an evil man's last curse.How and why, we don't know.. But this Boy who lived that Strange thing, must now lives with his last family, at this very Normal man's.Good luck Harry, Doorbells Dumbledore!!A very interesting Epic beginning. A fine example of how to grab attention without confusing readers with too much strangeness and complicated peculiar, invented names as most YA novels does.-for example the “Put-Outer” that put out the light off street lamps, has a more complicated name but it used way later in the books-Also it's very well paced, perfectly split between Normal life and Magical one, which is the essence of the series....in this Breaking Dawn of URBAN FANTASY as we know it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 2 : THE VANISHING GLASSChapter 3 : LETTERS FROM NO ONEChapter 4 : THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
These chapters (First Episode) are like normal, miserable drama.The boring -with minor strange events- life of the ""seems normal / yet Special"" orphan boy who lives in the cupboard under the stairs at his mean relatives'. Teased by his greedy, selfish, spoiled by parents, cousin “Duddly”.(
-Fun Trivia
; these chapters full with HUGE Easter Eggs of later books, Mrs Figg of book five/ Snakes talk of book Two “no Snakes winking though”, & did you notice the motorcycle's owner name in the 1st chapter?-)But this drama still very funny written in a way, Aunt Petunia stern acts and expressions for Harry, Harry’s wet responses, Uncle Vernon’s spoilings for Dudley.. It's really full of wet, funny unforgettable lines.And these letters that came to Harry when he turns 11, well, changed everything.(-Fun Trivia; Urban Myth that Uncle Vernon believed in; Witches & Wizards can't cross the water.. well, how wrong that can be!-)And this episode ends with the big Revelation;And the pretty Normal life is going to change forever for Harry, Thank you..very much.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 5 : DIAGON ALLEYChapter 6 : THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERSNow you know pretty enough of the Harry Potter back story, the dark vanquished wizard. and why everyone in this community were celebrating 10 years ago ‘the 1st chapter’, and why Harry Potter is famous.So Here, bit by bit you step into this Magical, Unique world.Cleverly, interestingly, this world is revealed to you, slowly as if told to 11 years old boy who has no clue of it.This  WIZARDING WORLD , is no Normal at all, thank you very much. It's huge realm and community, yet cleverly hidden in our own Normal world.It'll give you Wonder and Fascination from how to reach it, till being part of it.And as Harry learns about it, he will also meet these diversity of characters, specifically this amazing family, The Weasley’s.Yeah,this last line makes you feel that the author joining you the fun herself. It's hard to miss the fun sarcastic tone.And, Now you see, Harry first lesson before getting to this Strange School is this ;Wizards and Witches are pretty Normal.. the same as you and me, everyone has the good and bad.. just what you choose to be is what define who you are.(-Fun Trivia; there's many Easter Eggs in the small details “like Dumbledore’s Chocolate Frog information, which is vital this book, last book and even the next series” also for later books “like the silly Rat spell that won't work on The Rat”-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 7 : THE SORTING HATChapter 8 : THE POTIONS MASTERChapter 9 : THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
Now, amidst the Strangeness of the Wizarding World.. the humans there are so true and real. Hence all the situations are true and realistic..These first 3 chapters at Hogwarts gave me a strong Nostalgia to my first days of almost every school, the college even workplaces.Harry is 11 and his past Normal life didn’t prepare him to Hogwarts, this magnificent Fantastic Magical School. So the author's lingering on how Harry feels, even how every first year students acts in totally perfect way, and funny too.No matter how was your experience, you will re-live it but in this Magical atmosphere..Even you might feel you have acquaintances, colleagues or friends like one of those Harry Potter's characters in one point or another,There's always this simple true friendly type “Ron”,eager ambitious knows-it-all “Hermione”,smug bully Peacock “Draco”,always lost and confused “Neville”,funny troublemakers “George and Fred”,authority lover “Percy”,this older ""pet lover"" who knew one of your relatives and being so kind to you as an uncle “Hagrid”,this older guy you feel he hates you for no reason at all “Snape”,this stern, all powerful yet super kind older woman “McGonagall”,and you don't meet the Headmaster ‘or the Boss’ pretty often when it's your first year..but he may be like a Godfather to you later “Dumbledore”.These chapters of the first weeks, first encounters with different so real, so human characters, first lessons, all are pretty remarkable and nostalgic.Unforgettable lines; The Potion Master greeting Harry.And very funny; Harry confusion about Midnight Duel with Malfoy.And Hermione classic that the Movie Trailer made it even cinematic classic that many has been copying since.(-Fun Trivia; Argus Filch.. his first name in Greek myth is to a guard with hundreds of eyes all over his body to see everywhere. Well, Argus alone-with a cat- watches the whole vast buildings and hallways of Hogwarts..and you really can't escape him.There's also this theory about Snape’s first 3 questions to Harry is all related to the love of his life!!.-)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 10 : HALLOWEENChapter 11 : QUIDDITCHChapter 12 : THE MIRROR OF ERISED
Now, first half of the book is over -that fast?!!-, the second half has been brewing slowly since early first half..Remember there's some small package in Ch.5, you read something about a failed stealing attempt in Ch.8, then suspecting it might be the school's heavily guarded item in ch.9.With pure chances our Harry Potter witnessed it all so far.Now, also by chances, Harry start to suspect someone trying to steal it, from the school.It all start with a sequence of events that may some of it give you Nostalgia, like having annoying knows-it-all colleague.Well, then, one thing after another,And we have a Trio ;I want to be back in school already.Told you, it's perfect blending Between Normal, and Magic.And with this Troll accident, this Trio start suspecting the safety of whatever in the package at the third floor.In a Agatha Christie Mystery style, Investigations starts in Magic School,While playing Magical Sport that once you read its rules -twice-, you'll wish to play it,even if against the worst team ever, Slytherin.And While staying at school during Christmas, this intimate atmosphere, The Blessing of having wonderful friends who like a new family to you..even having family however they might be, but they're still your blood.. (as we’ll discuss that in later parts.)And above all, if we miss someone, the importance of Not “Dwelling” in the past,as Dumbledore said…(-Fun Trivia;; The Mirror of Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.-)And back to the plot.. Harry is not only investigate the safety of the parcel, or why Snape -Harry’s main and only suspect- wants to steal it ; the Trio also investigate the second owner of the parcel; He-who-next-Chapter-is-named-after.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 13 : NICOLAS FLAMELChapter 14 : NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACKChapter 15 : THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
With this Magical Urban Fantasy Novel, comes a minor element of Real Historical figure and real life myth. Nicolas Flamel, and His Philosopher’s Stone.(-Fun Trivia; And this is “The One when every child in our world knows about the Philosopher's Stone” -expect in America. They insisted that it's just Sorcerer’s Stone.)That's may be one great aspect of mixing this Fantastical Fictional World with our Real Not-Normal Life, Flamel is a real life Alchemist, that mix of Chemistry and Magic.That's what makes Harry Potter a fine example of Urban Fantasy.And in these 3 Chapters the investigations get more tense, with some events that put it in halt like, bad Quidditch referee.Or Hagrid’s Dangerous, forbidden Hobbies.-well, that's rich-Which get them- as Flich would say -“in trouble”, A detention in the forbidden forest, meeting the Centaurs and their mystic creepy speakings of how “Mars was Bright that night”.And finally there -which happens again by mere chance-, they will learn the real reason of the whole fuss around the parcel, The Philosopher’s Stone and who is behind the attempts to steal it.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter 16 : THROUGH THE TRAPDOORChapter 17 : THE MAN WITH TWO FACES
So now the perfect well structured Mystery and investigations, and the cleverly paced School year comes to an end.Right after the fast “nostalgic too” summing up of the Exams days, which was so realistic,So Classic, And then, the plan is On after the exam. For the big Action of this Magical enchanting plot of the first book ; and with all the tension there, the spontaneous, natural, fun lines between the friends never ceased.Even in the hardest parts can makes you smile.This amazing ultimate real meaning of friends completing one another.That’s what can really help in facing Evil.. and not fearing death.. And choose well,As Professor Dumbledore’s wise talk;And Love, and being Loved is the strongest power of all to face anything.So it was story of Love, Friendship, Family and Bravery.A perfect conclusion for a Perfect First Book in Unforgettable Breaking Point in modern Fantasy, Young Adult Novels. And in novels History generally.A story that touched me personally, and may touched so many.. felt so connected to those amazing realistic characters..And as the investigations part ends finally, it was moment for Truth.-that may remind you with Agatha’s Poirot Quote ; “The truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and beautiful to seekers after it.”So, we still won't have the full answers we seek and have in our mind such as;If this is a great story, Why would a Man even so evil as Voldemort would be that keen to kill baby Harry that much in the first place?Will he return? Will it be convenience one?Well, in later books you'll see that everything is connected, mostly -NOT TOTALLY-planned from the beginning.Well… if you still think this is an overrated Book Series..and doubt the accuracy of this first line, then you're seriously have some Uncle Vernon Dursley blood in you.But cheers, you are Perfectly Normal,Thank You Very Much.Mohammed ArabeyFirst Read : Sep. 2002Illustrated Ed.

It starts early and picks up speed, burning through pages, right to the reveal, which is quite the surprise--no Scooby-Doo ending here.But the thing that really makes this book stand out is the characters. Harry Potter ended up getting on my last nerve in the series, but in this book, he's crazy likable. The minor characters are what really make the series, though. They have more personality than the protagonist of most books.This series might not be the best, but there's nothing like it. It's just magical. Plain and simple.

THE PROSECUTION
 - Rowling is occasionally too over-the-top for her own good (especially during Harry's time with the Dursleys) - After reading this, anything else you do may seem like a waste of time that you could have used to read Harry Potter again!
THE VERDICT
Some books are worth reading once, this one is worthy reading many times! A brilliant adventure that anyone can enjoy!

Fairly standard kid's fantasy fare from Rowling as she re-introduces the world to the classic British fairy tale, which had been mostly forgotten since Tolkien spliced it with the epic. She mines gold from this rich and storied tradition, but doesn't really fashion anything unique from it.We can see the beginnings of Rowling's authorial failings (and a hint of her strengths as well). She adopts Rouald Dahl's 'awful family' trope, though it's clear that Rowling does not have the gift of bizarre characterization or the knowledge of the darker parts of the human soul that made his books resonate.She writes sympathetic characters, but not unusual ones. Overall her writing has relatively little character or style. Then again, mass success often requires leaving the more unusual elements behind. So she relies on standard character types, managing to keep them afloat through the patented perpetual plot of the airplane book.She also pulls from that old British tradition of 'children lost in fairyland', seen often in early fantasy (Dunsany, Eddison), which Lewis also made use of. She also has the vast, unknown underground of magic just beneath our world which keeps itself always mysterious and quiet, much favored by Gaiman and other Urban Fantasy authors (though Rowling's invented world is strained and piecemeal, moreso as the series goes on).The strength of the book is that it combines the tradition of the 'child in fairyland' with another British standby: the boarding school bildungsroman. It's the same neat trick Mervyn Peake pulled in 'Gormenghast', though Rowling's version is tame in comparison. Her tale of the intellectual, emotional, and physical growth of the young, outcast everyman is rather predictable, except for some insight into angst in the fifth book.Rowling's prose is quick and simple, but sometimes awkward and without music or joy. It is not the sort of deliberate simplicity Carroll achieved by expressing complex ideas in playful terms. It is rather the sign of an author whose unsophisticated voice prevents her language from vaulting higher.Simplistic elegance is deceptively difficult to achieve, and so it's hard to blame Rowling too much when she falters. It's unfortunate that she didn't put a few failed books under her belt before finding success, as such early outings are often best winnowed chaff.Her plotting--as ever--is scattered and convenient; though in a shorter book, it shows less. Her plot twists, as usual, disappoint; they are not built upon progression of events but upon reader expectation and emotional red herrings.It's the beginning of an enjoyable series, but there's really no need to start any earlier than the third book, when Rowling finally finds her pace and begins to lean more heavily on that which she does well, which helps to hide her faults. Watch the movie if you need a primer.My Fantasy Book Suggestions

And WOW! Just WOW! Thank goodness I decided to read it again because it felt so magical and magnificent and totally breathtaking! -- exactly what I've felt the first time I've read this.Harry Potter is such a great, well-fleshed out character. Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids, he still stood up and even became a great friend to Ron, Hermione, Neville, and the others. This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book. It was just so awesome! The secondary characters are also perfect. I especially love Hermione and her genius mind! Ron's loyalty towards Harry is also awe-inspiring, as well as Neville's adorable clumsiness. When it comes to its plotline, it's amazingly done. The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh. What's even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader, fantasy and magic aside.

""It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.""

I loved all the chapters and my favorites are:The Boy Who Lived, The Vanishing Glass, Diagon Alley, The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, The Sorting Hat, and Quidditch.No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation. J.K. Rowling is so brilliant she bewitched me with her world! So excited to find out more about this series and to see what's in store for Harry in the next books. :)Rating:

I used to hate Harry Potter.Now before you hoist your pitchforks and torches, allow me to explain.When I was a wee child of six, my dad decided it'd be a good idea to introduce me to the series—starting from the Goblet of Fire. Back then, I was a vivacious reader, but mainly of chapter books, like Junie B. Jones or Bailey School Kids. The thickest book I'd read was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.So when my dad plunked this gigantic doorstopper of a book in front of me, I quickly lost interest and deemed Harry Potter boring and overhyped. I carried this opinion through my teenage years, rolling my eyes at the people who'd pillaged bookstores at midnight and refusing my uncle's generous offer to purchase me the entire series because he knew I liked to read.Fast forward to 2009, when I was deep in the clutches of Twilight and desperate for something to fill the power vacuum Breaking Dawn had left. Then I stumbled across Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in my school library.""What the hell,"" I'd thought. ""There's nothing else to read anyway.""I'd settled on a cushy couch, flicked to the first page and laid eyes on this: ""Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much."" It was all over for me. I read past the tardy bell, begged the librarian to let me keep it, even though we weren't allowed to check out books that early on in the school year. I zoomed through it in class and snuck the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azaban home under my coat. I even pleaded my mother to haul The Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, those thick, heavy hardbacks, home from her school's library (my mom's a teacher), so I wouldn't be left Potter-less during the weekend. Having come across them long overdue, I knew major spoilers, including who would die in the end, yet it still broke my heart when I read The Deathly Hallows.There are no words to describe how much I love Harry Potter, and how much I want to smack my 14-year-old for obsessing over a controlling, douchebag vampire when I could have been laughing and swooning at Fred and George Weasley's antics.I am not part of the Potter generation.

The good thing is that I don't really remember anything at all, haha (just the ""big"" parts. Oh, and also the deaths *cries*). Sooo, I loved this book and I'm impressed by that! I mean, I knew I was going to like it! But it was so much more. Since the first page it had me hooked. J.K. Rowling has such a fluid writing style! I never got bored and I was gasping in some parts even when I knew what was going to happen!Can't wait to read the next books :).

I'm happy to chat about the definition of literature with you, or what I think about the Harry Potter phenomenon now or whatever, but try and be civil and don't attack me right out of the gate.EDIT NOTE in 2011: I've edited this review to take out some teenage arrogance, but the rest is as-is. A few years later and with a degree in hand, including modules in Children's Lit, I could probably write a better review, but people seem to like this one!I really don't like Harry Potter. It's one of those little concealed but apparently not widely known facts about me, which shocks everyone when I say I love books and they're all, ""yeah, rite, Harry Potter is so awesum rite?"" and I say ""...no, it really isn't."" I confess: when I was eleven or twelve or so, I read them. I also read the Sabrina the Teenage Witch novels. I read everything and wasn't very discriminating about it. I did enjoy them. I continued to enjoy them until I got to Order of the Phoenix, and then I decided that all the hype aside, I just wasn't interested anymore. Bear in mind, then, for the rest of this ""essay"", that I have only read up to and including The Goblet of Fire.Cue a few years of irritation while everyone insisted I must read the rest of the books, and how dare I prefer Tolkien and Ursula Le Guin (and later, Susan Cooper). I have really no objection to people reading the books and enjoying them, taking part in the fandom that surrounds them, dressing up in witchy costumes to go and pick up the most recently released volume at midnight. Have fun with that! As far as I'm concerned you're welcome to. I'm even quite happy to concede that yes, Harry Potter did get more people reading. Whether it got them reading literature or not is another matter: how many people, I wonder, have discovered a mania for reading after reading Harry Potter and then gone onto the likes of Crime and Punishment and War and Peace, or even Lord of the Rings? Not that many, I'll bet. I think they're probably reading Twilight and the like, more often than not. Not that it matters -- as long as people are reading.But in any case, I. Don't. Have. To. Read. Them. Just because I like books, does not mean I like those books. And I detest it every time someone shoves them in my face as 'great literature'. I actually had to study Harry Potter, for my English Lit/Lang A Level (for those unfamiliar with our system: A Levels are exams you take when you're about eighteen, which among other things determine whether you can go to university). One of the questions we had to figure out how to answer was whether we thought Harry Potter was good literature, whether we thought it would stand the test of time, and how it was suited to the time it's currently in.It was then that I figured out that, yeah, there are things wrong with Harry Potter beyond just the hype that was irritating me so much and the feeling that Rowling in no way matched up to the giants of fantasy and sci-fi, like Tolkien. I studied it alongside Tom Brown's Schooldays, by Thomas Hughes. Do note that I didn't like that book either. But it's a well written, well shaped, well considered book -- and it doesn't use the same cheap tricks as Harry Potter does. I'm not going to say much about that, since it's not a book I liked: if I'm going to compare/contrast, I'll compare with my favourite book that is also supposed to be for younger readers, Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising.There's nothing wrong with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone being an amateur first novel. 'cause that's what it is. I'm sure many people's first novels don't even see the light of day, and yet Harry Potter somehow made it to a publisher's and was accepted. The thing is, people mostly refuse to recognise that and the cheap tricks J. K. Rowling uses. For example, her character's names. 'Draco Malfoy'. Mal, the French for bad, immediately obvious. 'Draco', suggesting dragon? Or perhaps 'draconian', which has negative connotations aplenty (not that I'd necessarily attribute those particular ones to Draco). Not very subtle, is it? 'Dumbledore'. Who doesn't get the image of a well-meaning, if strange, old man? 'Minerva', straight out of Greek myth: a goddess of knowledge. Gee, I wonder why Rowling chose that for a female teacher... 'Remus Lupin', 'Sirius Black', 'Mad-Eye Moody'... Do I even have to say anything?And 'Harry Potter'. Nothing striking about that: perfectly ordinary, as names go, right?Yeah. And that's the point. Harry Potter himself is not a real character -- certainly not at first. He's a cypher, a convenient space into which a kid can very easily insert himself or even herself. He's brave. Okay, generic hero characteristic. He has doubts. Again, the same. He has a Tragic Past. Don't we all? Or don't we all like to think we do? Look at the Mary Sues/self inserts people write in fandom -- so often they're people with incredibly dark, melodramatic pasts that they rise above. Harry Potter is a convenient place to insert yourself. The other characters are archetypes more than anything -- Hermione, the know it all girl; Ron, the loyal friend; Dumbledore, the mentor; Malfoy, the rival...All of that is actually what makes Harry Potter a highly readable, enjoyable book, for young people and even adults. It's targeted very precisely toward the readership of today. Maybe that makes J. K. Rowling a better author than I might paint her as, that she can know her audience so well -- there's that view, I'm sure. But it's all very basic, and I tend to look on it as cheap tricks. The whole chapter, in the first book, about the Mirror of Erised -- how sad does it make you feel for Harry? It's sentimental, it's sad -- and it's meant to do that, very obviously. There's a whole chapter written just to enforce the love between the members of Harry Potter's family.Susan Cooper does it in a single paragraph that makes me want to cry every single time I read it, coming after all the build up of guilt and pain in the relationship. ""Bran went to [his father] and put his arm round his waist, and stood close. It was the first gesture of affection between the two that Will had ever seen. And wondering, loving surprise woke in Owen Davies's worn face as he looked down at the boy's white head, and the two stood there, waiting.""That paragraph does for me what Rowling's whole chapter cannot. It's so effective, actually, because Cooper spends a whole book leading up to it, showing us Owen and Bran's relationship. Rowling shows us Harry's parents, but in an unsubtle way that actually throws me out of it because I think, ""Oh, yeah, this is the chapter in which we're supposed to feel very sorry for Harry.""There's also a very easy, blunt misdirection. You're supposed to hate Snape, supposed to believe he's the one to blame for everything, and at the end, you're supposed to be as surprised as Harry when it's Quirrel waiting there for him. At the age of eleven, I think I went right along with that, but when I reread it for A Level, I had to wince at how heavy-handed the misdirection was. I understand that later in the series Snape comes into it more, and I don't know whether the misdirection turns out to be not that misdirected when it comes down to the real truth: but in the first book, you're meant to believe it's Snape all along, and I don't think J. K. Rowling does a very good job of giving us clues that it's not actually Snape, because she's so busy blackening him to lead people astray.It's also very black-and-white. Questions aren't raised, by this story -- and that's a thing I think is actually important in literature. Raise questions, discuss issues, end with a question. I don't know what to call stories that don't fit into that, really. I'm going to go with 'novels' as opposed to literature. Harry Potter is a novel. It's a story. I don't think it has any real lasting values. Susan Cooper's books, while also quite basic, discussing the Light and the Dark, do end with a question. If man is left on earth, to do as man will, will man be Light or Dark? The immortals leave earth, and say that the world -- for better or worse -- belongs to humans. Right now, a lot of people think the answer to that question would be 'worse'. But Harry Potter does not raise this question, does not raise any question, and does not answer one either. That's why I don't think it will last except perhaps as a phenomenon to be studied: the 'Potter mania' and what caused it.That's why I don't like Rowling's writing. It's not particularly refined, it's unsubtle -- and that's okay, you know, I'm not saying you can't enjoy that, can't find it refreshing. I don't. I'm also not saying that 'novels' are bad -- they're good, they can provide valuable escapism, they can be incredibly rich fodder for the imagination, and I suspect Harry Potter is, for many children. But I don't call it literature, and I myself don't like it.Note: the three star rating is because honestly, when I first read it, I did love it.

Reading these now as a child of that age must be great, but reading them as a child of that age, Harry's age, as they were published, was just the best reading experience I've ever had and without a doubt will ever have. 
'Harry -- yer a wizard.'
I wasn't allowed to read them, you see. My parents regarded them as something slightly dangerous, promoting witchcraft and such nonsense. What rubbish. I saw the first movie on my last day at primary school, and I loved it. I loved the talking hats, the flying brooms, and the magic. So I collected my small pocket money and bought the first book myself once I was at secondary school which almost made me miss the bus. I smuggled it inside my room and once my father had left for work, I read it in a single day. 
'There will be books written about Harry. Every child in the world will know his name.'
As you may have guessed, reading this one illegally in my small room, always having an ear turned towards the stairs, heavily affected my reading experience. Because I could relate to Harry so very much. To scrawny Harry with the messy hair who had such a shitty life. Of course, I wasn't forced to live in a cupboard, but as I said, my room was very small. And we had a very big house which made that room even smaller. Also, I didn't have the happiest of childhoods. So this touched me. Reading about Harry being bullied by Dudley at school and at home also touched me, because I was also bullied at that time - I was always smaller than the other kids at school, and I was always very bookish which didn't help at all. So when little Harry got that letter, I was caught in Rowling's net, and I've never left it. After the holidays, I spent my lunch breaks at school in the school library. Reading Chamber of Secrets, obviously, but that's another story.
'Ah, music,' he said, wiping his eyes. 'A magic beyond all we do here!'
This will forever be my favourite book. I've read it around 16 times now, and I'll definitely read it again. How can you not love this? It's about a little orphan boy whose childhood is a never-ending series of horror and abuse, until his eleventh birthday. Then little Harry finds out that his parents were wizards, that he also is a wizard and that he can leave his shitty, terrible relatives to go to a school for witchcraft, where he finds the best friends possible, learns to do actual magic and comes to be one of the greatest heroes in the history of literature.
'There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.'
This book has a half-giant who'd love to have a dragon as a pet, said baby dragon named Norbert, and a cerberus called Fluffy. It has Quidditch, talking portraits, and it has people who send toilet seats as a gift. It's filled with hope, friendship and  magic.  It's perfect. The only thing which could have made it more perfect is the illustrated edition. People might say it's stupid to pay that much money to read a book you've read so many times, but Jim Kay's pictures really make this even better. And the author? Honestly, nothing she does or says can affect the way I feel about these books and characters. They'll always have a special place right in the middle of my heart. My love for them knows no boundaries. Seriously. I have read over a hundred fanfictions of this series. And written my own. To this day, I'd leave immediately if that stupid owl would finally show up with my Hogwarts letter. Seriously, what's taking so long? Er...anyway, did I mention that I love the Harry Potter series? -----Edit: I realized that I hadn’t blessed this review with GIFS, so I added some.

I'm not going to comment on the literary shortcomings of this book, the cliches, the painfully long narrative, the fact that the characters will not think about an issue for months, but then suddenly it becomes important again. Smarter people than me have already said all this.What bothers me about the Harry Potter universe is its characterization of magic. Why is magic so easy in the Harry Potter universe? It's only moderately a matter of skill to use magic. Magic is mostly saying the correct word with the correct intonation and the correct flourish of the wand and boom! you've done something magical. If it were only for small things I don't think this would bother me so much, but the same works for more serious things, like killing someone.There is so much that is contrary to logic (and I don't mean science, I mean how reasonable people would behave) in the magic of Harry Potter that it drives me crazy. Why is the magical world so separated from the real world? What is their interaction? If magic works in the muggle world, what is preventing someone like Voldemort from completely taking over the muggle world? What is preventing any character from killing any other character by simpling saying the killing curse at any time? Human decency? Obviously there are a lot of characters in the books that don't have any. This never made any sense to me.I would like to draw a comparison with (and I'm sure people on a site about reading books will crucify me for mentioning TV, which is obviously incapable of being an art form) Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In Buffy, every time you use magic, you pay for it. For little things, like floating a pencil, you pay for it in concentration, and maybe a little physical energy, but not more than going for a walk. However, the more you take, the more you have to give back in one form or another. The show is not always entirely consistent on this, but the idea makes sense. To bring someone back from the dead, you have to kill something else, or pay some other kind of price. If you want to kill someone, there is a physical price, a mental price. Nothing is free. In Harry Potter, it seems like everything is free.It's always put me off, and every time a fan tries to explain to me why I'm wrong it sounds like a deus ex machina, or just a plain old stretch.Also, quidditch is the most pointless sport ever created. Only in 1 game out of 1000 does anything 99% of the action matter to the outcome of the game. Only the seeker and the bludgers mean anything.

Maybe it's because of all the tumblr headcanon I've read, but I honestly cried when he opened his Christmas presents and when he went to see his parents in the mirror every night. (tbh everything about this book made me emotional.)This reread also made me realize how many serious topics HP touches on: bullying, making friends, loss, love, etc.

Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever.”Buddy read with the one who started it all!Ya gurllllll did it! After 25 years on this earth, and the book has been out for however long, it’s done. I’ve read the first instalment of the Harry Potter series and I loved every single minute of it. Better late than never right? Firstly I read this, and then switched to the audiobook while I was at work (a girls got to do, what a girls got to do) and honestly it was amazing! Stephen Fry as the narrator was EVERYTHING. I was LIVING for it! Special shout out to how he portrays Hermione and Hagrid, I was just. I can’t even put into words how amazing it was.Now I knew it was going to be good, but did I think it was going to be THAT good?! Nope. It had a little bit of everything; friendships, magic, muggles, world building, enemies, snippets into other characters, hilarious moments, intense moments and so much more.I’m not really going to go into a lot of detail with characters as I’m pretty sure everyone knows them by now… BUT I’m just going to quickly note that I would ever find Neville to be such an endearing character with his bravery and friendships (especially Hermione). Then there was Hagrid with his Dragon, calling himself mummy, doing lovely little things for Harry. I just can’t cope with it all!So… What I liked?- ALL of the humour! I just. Ahhhhh. I didn't think I'd laugh so much!- MAGIC- How all of the friendships came around, I liked that Hermione wasn’t instantly in with them- Hermione as a whole had some amazing moments- Hagrid making a book of photographs for Harry… my heart!- The description of Voldemort, like I didn’t know he had red eyes and his nose situation made more sense (plz on’t judge me aha)- All of the mystical creatures along the wayI could go on and on but I’ll stop...What I didn’t like?- I don’t know if it’s because I’m only just reading this now or what, but the final kind of showdown was over a bit quickly, like one minute something was happening and then nothing? I know, I know… I still loved it though!Overall I’m thinking to myself “why did you wait this long you fool”. I can't wait to get on with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.“It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”Philosopher’s Stone - 4.5 Stars Chamber of Secrets - 4 StarsPrisoner of Azkaban - 5 StarsGoblet of Fire - 4.5 StarsOrder of the Phoenix - 4.5 Stars

Can't put all her brilliant twists out at once...*heavy sarcasm*Don't even get me started on the plot. Epic failure. 'Nuff said.Harry wasn't any excuse for a hero. He did nothing, he just sat around and things happened to him. End of story. His fame was inherited, his fortune was inherited, he lived with his relations and allowed them to bully him, and couldn't even manage to read his own mail. His wonderful skills were not worked at and studied for years but picked up instantly, and he bet the bad guys by electrocuting them with his infamous zapper skin.I could go on for hours. The thing that really gets to me is that this is the great literature of our age? What hope is there for any decent writers if all kids want to read is this utter garbage? What hope is there for the world if kids are growing up thinking this is good literature?This is a dangerous book. It made me consider both suicide and mass homicide, and it is definitely not suitable for children.

That is where the day took a strange turn...Vernon just chose to ignore it.He ignored the cat reading a map on the street corner outside his home. He ignored the people dressed in cloaks...He ignored the owls flying outside his window at work- and after some careful consideration, he decided to also ignore the whispers on the streets outside at lunch- mentioning the name Harry Potter, and the strange man that hugged him for no reason...If Vernon had been a different sort of man- he would have known life was about to change for his ""happy' little family.The street lights on Privet drive flicker off one by one- and a group of four gather just outside the Dursley residence. Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hargrid, set baby Harry and a letter on the doorstep. For Harry Potter isn't just any child and must be kept safe. One day he will know who he is, and one day they will come back for him.First off I would like to thank my friend Stepheny- for finally being the one to give me that extra push I needed to give in and read this wonderful book- and I do mean PUSH.

Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.

“I’m going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.” — Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead’s questions — and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil’s Snare, Harry’s best mate Ron bellows “HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him “Are you a wizard, or what?” thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry’s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret “shout-out” to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that “neither shall live while the other survives”, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort’s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn’t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn’t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling’s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.

""OI! There's a war going on here!""""Merlin's Pants!""The six-year build-up is over. The final adventure, towards which we've been sailing for - through six amazing Hogwarts years - is here at last. And yet again, Rowling surpasses her own standards to bring us the most adventurous book of the entire series, to conclude everything is a most dramatic way. Twist after twist after twist is going to keep the reader immersed more than ever. Be warned: once started, you won't have a moment's rest till your finish this one!""Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches""It seems redundant now to repeat all the good things about Harry Potter books in general - from plot to writing style - which never reached a plateau, but kept on improving. All of that is still there. But setting up the atmosphere for events has reached a level that is far beyond anything we've seen before. And the complexity of the events has also been increased. Even the few sup-plots are highly detailed and complex, and contributes a lot to the main story. It gives a very fulfilling feeling, when the reader is allowed to connect all the dots as progressing towards the end, tying up a lot of loose ends. Also, it's unbelievable how well the plot twists are introduced - whether they are happy or sad - maintaining suspense better than ever.""permettez-moi to assister vous,""The reader is bound to encounter a lot of heartbreaking disappointments here, but all that help make the ending much more satisfying. I did miss the occasional humor, though it would not have complimented well the dark world we are in right now. Oh, and I'm really happy that I only had to hate Snape for a few days... (from finish of Half-blood prince till now) I guess that's the good thing about reading all the books of series at once: less anxiety!""Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure!""When I started Philosopher's Stone, it made me realize that I've been missing out on a lot - a world of magic which is full of amazing characters. Then the journey got ever so thrilling and entertaining, with each book outperforming the previous one in every possible way. It's been three magical weeks for me - literally and figuratively - from the starting of the first book till the last. I don't recall ever been immersed in a book series as much as I did with Harry Potter, and, though the ending was great, it's sad not being able to continue, to know that this is the end. I've watched the first few HP movies a long time ago, but those didn't come anywhere near the books in my opinion, and I really wasn't a fan. But now, I'm finally enlightened as to why Harry Potter series is much loved by millions. It's impossible not to, once you're through with the books! A well thought out foundation put in place in first three books, then setting stage for the core of the series in next two and finally, an incredibly thrilling ending with the last two books, while each book being a five-star read, at least for me. Harry Potter became the my all-time-favorite book series. ""Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,""

Hot take: I like A Very Potter Musical more than I like the Harry Potter series. Please feel free to physically fight me. (And no, “AVPM wouldn’t exist without the series” is not a valid argument, because duh.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...God, what an unexpected result this is. Let's talk about it for six pages. I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series for five months. More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February, and I didn’t pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort’s, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let’s talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin’ but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw those glorious GIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like, What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we’re eating? (Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying “Accio salmon” in order to eat and were just like, That information’s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and take literally no effort by the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I’m almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it’s over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I’m big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We’ll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he’s Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he’s treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD’S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that’s who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He’s barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we’ll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN’T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT’S “Garry”) just based off of Ginny’s apparent greatness. BUT NO IT’S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn’t be less cute. It’s just I miss Ginnyyyyyyyyy overandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It’s just J.K. Rowling being like, Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here’s a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne, Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer. SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN’S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don’t...I don’t even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn’t Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn’t Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she’s all, “Why won’t Lupin loooooooove me.” Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn’t mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn’t mean that James’s dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don’t just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, “Oh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I’ll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it’s almost like I’ve emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!”You can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She’s a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can’t!!! Because she keeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, “You and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,” which is really Joanne saying, “I have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?”Here’s one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there’s a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly “dies” when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry that isn’t, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily’s protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I’M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I’M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain’t seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I’m going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is “get in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.” AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped. either that or this book was garbàge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request. (the whole contract is fine print.)ah jesus. you guys thought you hated me before.review to comeeeeee-------------------------me waiting for this book to be over

I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying ""Voldemort""'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no ""new"" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the ""real responsibilities"" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any ""Exaggeration"" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn   The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.ِِAnd look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER
“You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .” “What is this?” Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. “It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of Love So glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

I liked that.but the newspaper articles about the backstory was boring. & the part before the main story begins, & the camping-no-clues part, without anything interesting (or useful) happens were slow.This is the most emotional book in HP series; from the beginning. maybe the most crying book of my whole life:I cried at first, 25%, in the middle, later in the middle, in 75% & many times toward the end:(view spoiler)[Hedwig's death, Kreacher's tale & Regulus' bravery & kindness & acts trying to make his mistake right (why if my fav character is not the main hero, they ended up already dead?!😭 James & Regulus), the scene of James & Lily's death was very emotional, especially at the end when little Harry found out something was wrong, Luna's room, even cried (a bit tho) for wormtail, Dobby's death, many Deaths in the battle of Hogwarts😭 the Forest again; how he felt about Life when it was going to an end, his courage to face the his destiny... & Always (I liked Snape just because he made hard times for Harry. (ahhhh Evil me!) although I can't forgive Snape as Harry did; but this part was very emotional & he turned out to be a hero.) (hide spoiler)] sobbing & curling in the corner. (I am even crying now as I'm just typing these.)always crying; at all the readings.also Stephen Fry narrating was amazing; made me cry even more & also at the last 40%.All his emotions not just in quotes, but in Harry's thoughts, memories & feelings, all their tones, all parts their voices broke, shattered or trembled, now very very tangible & more realistic. (better than my imagination; also Harry's voice is exactly the voice I always heard in my head reading the books.)I love this book!I think in my 7th read, I cried even more over my most crying book.(I mean, I cried all over the 'forest again' chapter & the last sentences made me completely burst into tears.)don't worry, it has fun times too.the ending was brilliant! mysteries solved! (& I'm mad about changing it in the movie!)epic battle! (view spoiler)[I had kinda subconsciously known before I read it for the first time that where the end battle would be. it just made sense that way. back Home one last time, defend Hogwarts.“Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known.”(I mean can you imagine the battle between Harry & Voldemort after he found all the horcruxes happening in like an unknown nowhere forest or something?nope, right? XD) (hide spoiler)]Romione & then Harry's reaction was priceless!and the Flaw in the Plan....One of my favourite chapters in the whole HP! I love the last battle. I love the way Harry explained it. (confident! courageous! sassy! taunting!) the clues even I, as a reader, might have missed. (at least in the first read I did. that's the whole point of a story being a legend, you don't see the clues wrapping up in the story until it's explained & next times you re-read it, you'll see them.)I can read those last 3 chapters over & over again.so exciting! so epic! so brilliant! (& they CHANGED that in the movies! How DARE they!?)I was at the edge of my seat for the last 30%. all of it. in most of my readings. so thrilling! never gets old!Harry is smart & brave.& I love the epilogue. fun & great.2021 May: now I can say I read the whole HP series 10 times, yay! until next time!& at my first read, I was afraid about how the story would be ended (because Harry is my favourite character) & this was my first series (no experience, no reader prediction ability, etc, etc.(view spoiler)[& I thought he must die (& at that time, I didn't have a clue he was ""you-know-what"". I just thought the story only ended when Harry dies. (actually I was afraid series only ended when the hero dies in General, so that way no other books would come out.) I'm actually thinking I was kind of right at some points. I'm surprised!but you know...All was well..

I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, and theme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well.

Here are three reasons why this book is dynamite:1. This series never lost any momentum and here it ended spectacularly in such a dramatic final confrontation.  2. Rowling shows us that even the nastiest of people deserve a degree of sympathy. Draco’s story was more complex than we realised. He was never the person he secretly wanted to be: a good man.  3.This scene was written superbly, the saddest moment of the series for me.

To you, yes you, reader of this review
, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you’ll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don’t tell me you haven’t been warned.^^
To J.K. Rowling, 
there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can’t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you’re still human and surely you’ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can’t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? Haven’t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don’t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don’t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don’t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor Moody’s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn’t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings. 
To Harry Potter
, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.  
To Hermione Granger 
, you are the most kick-ass heroine I’ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest. 
To Ron Weasley
, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.  
To Fred and George
, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, it’s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)] 
To Hagrid (and Graupy) 
, *hugs* I’ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.  
To Professor Snape,
you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore’s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails* 
To Professor Dumbledore
, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving. 
To Dumbledore’s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,
, you guys are awesome! 
To the Order of the Phoenix,
 you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I’m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much. 
To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall
, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant! 
To the Malfoys,
uh I don’t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you! 
To Dobby, 
 *wails* I can’t…just thank you so much. You’re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know. 
To Kreacher,
 you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle. 
To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback
, I have two words foryou. “AVADA KEDAVRA!” 
To Umbridge,
 off to Azkaban, you go!  
To Voldemort
, that’s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you? 
To the rest of the fallen,
 (view spoiler)[Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler)], like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails* 
To the movie makers and actors
, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^
To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,
 thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.
To Jia and Kyra
, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! <3

REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW
'Do not Pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.'
it still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters.maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her "" Loony "" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville.like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now.This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,,(view spoiler)[ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more.   (hide spoiler)]I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K. Rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person. Thank you very much, Mrs. J. K. Rowling and thank you very much for reading this guys. ❤❤❤P.S. I found all these wonderful pictures on Google. Many thanks for the creators.

***SPOILERS:From an interview with Rowling on the Today show:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19...Rowling said her original epilogue was “a lot more detailed,” including the name of every child born to the Weasley clan in the past 19 years. (Victoire, who was snogging Teddy — Lupin and Tonks’ son — is Bill and Fleur’s eldest.)Harry, Ron and HermioneWe know that Harry marries Ginny and has three kids, essentially, as Rowling explains, creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child.As for his occupation, Harry, along with Ron, is working at the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. After all these years, Harry is now the department head.“Harry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department,” Rowling said. “They are now the experts. It doesn’t matter how old they are or what else they’ve done.”Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron’s wife, is “pretty high up” in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in “Deathly Hallows.”“I would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding,” Rowling said.Harry, Ron and Hermione don’t join the same Ministry of Magic they had been at odds with for years; they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a “really good place to be.”“They made a new world,” Rowling said.The wizarding naturalistLuna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum.“I think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,” Rowling said. “She’s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.”Luna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don’t exist.“But I do think that she’s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one’s ever seen before,” Rowling said.Luna and Neville Longbottom?It’s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A.When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling’s response was “Definitely not.” But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to “feel a bit of a pull” between the unlikely pair.Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise “felt too neat.”Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom: “The damage is done.”There is no chance, however, that Neville’s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies.“I know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville’s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry’s parents,” Rowling said. “The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.”Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother’s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts.The fate of HogwartsNineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (“McGonagall was really getting on a bit”) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort’s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.While Rowling didn’t clarify whether Harry, Ron and Hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year, she did say she could see Harry popping up every now and again to give the “odd talk” on Defense Against the D

Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said, the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime). However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets. I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters. This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help. If you still love Harry Potter that’s okay but stop supporting Rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets. Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience. PS. I have this on the signed section because my copy is signed by Daniel Radcliffe (who in my head is now the real author of Harry Potter anyway):

The book begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the run doing the task that Dumbledore gave Harry. To be honest, the first part of the book (and by first part, I mean the first 70-80% or so) was a little slow for me. There were exciting things to pop up here and there, but a lot of it was slow. Then the last few hours of the audiobook happened. I’ve gotta say, once this trio got back to Hogwarts, the ending was epic. There were moments of sorrow, moments that made me laugh, smile, cry… it was very emotional (view spoiler)[GAWD that Snape scene.… I can’t even! It made me cry like a baby. And love a character I didn’t care for much! (hide spoiler)]. I’m pleased with the way it ended. Overall, this series has been fantastic for me. I’m so glad I finally made the time to read them all. I’ve always loved the movies and been a fan, but now I feel like I need to go and re-watch everything! Harry Potter is a heartwarming series with courageous characters that I will hold near and dear to my heart.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows literally touched the deepest part of my heart. This book has many layers and each one was refined by the smartest author I've ever known. J.K. Rowling always has a plan, she never threw anything into her books without thinking it first. In this case, I think she planned the ending of this book since she started writing for sure, and every point she emphasized in HP 7 was unfaltering and made me believe that it's a pure diamond when she ended her story with an epic score.
“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” 
Harry, Ron and Hermione prove themselves that they're just ordinary humans. They bicker. They argue each other. They make the sly plan. Importantly, they get to know how to forgive and forget, that's all that matters.
“We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”
This book is EVERYTHING. It became much more than just a fiction for me. It had its voice and when it whispered in my ears, I literally believed that there was magic in this world. Each chapter made me strong and wanted to be someone better. Each character epitomized a different kind of person. This book doesn't deserve five stars review, it's beyond measure and a thousand stars are not even enough.
Albus Severus,"" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, ""you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

I bought it at a midnight release party, devoured it, and knew that I loved it.But now that I've spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son, I understand why I loved it so much. Does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what Rowling did with this book? She spent years upon years, and six other books building a world and populating it with characters, and then she BROUGHT IT AND THEM ALL TOGETHER. Spells, tools, people, events, that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books were now smoothly woven together into this last great battle. And yes, they spend a lot of time camping, but as Harry says to Ron, ""Did you think we'd be finding a Horcrux a day?"" No, I didn't, or at least I hoped that they wouldn't, because that would have been too pat, too unrealistic. Instead, they had to search, they had to learn, they had to struggle, and be bored, and be lost, and then find what they needed. The Ron-Harry-Hermione friendship is tested, and found to be unbreakable. Ron and Hermione's relationship moves forward, Harry has time to reflect on his life, the people who have helped him, what his future might hold.And I loved it. I loved the moments of solemn reflection. I loved the testing of loyalties, revelations about the youth of Dumbledore and Snape (and if you don't bawl like a baby reading about Snape's memories, YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Lily and even Petunia. There are no throwaway characters in Rowling's world, yet it isn't just some endless catalogue of: And Dean did this, and Neville did this . . . Everything is part of one whole, beautiful story. The Weasleys continue to show their strength and love for Harry (and if you don't cry when Percy shows up, or when Fred . . . you know . . . YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Neville proves that he is his parents' son, and a true Gryffindor . . . and in short, there are so many stand up and cheer moments that I couldn't sit still while I was reading it. Of course, there are many, many tragedies, but after each tragedy, a moment of triumph to balance it, for which I say:Thank you, J. K. Rowling, for creating one of the best, most magical series for children of all time. Thank you for giving us Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny and Luna, and so many wonderful moments.And thank you, most of all, for not screwing up the grand finale.Best. Series ender. Ever.2017: Reread to the kids. First time for daughter (age 8). Managed to keep it mostly together through the end, had to have the 12yo read Molly's fight with Bellatrix and the last couple of paragraphs.

I fell in love with the poor, starved-for-affection, later known to be a twit Harry. I fell in love with the pretentious know-it-all Hermione. I fell in love with the awkward, grew-up-in-his-brother's-shadows Ron... and most of all? I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape.Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. This is the Seventh Book. This is the end of Harry Potter. I cried, I wept, I laughed, sometimes quite hysterically. And overall? I loved it. I loved Ron's humour, Harry's angst, Hermione's smarts, Snape's devotion, Dumbledore's love, Percy's return, Dobby's sacrifice, the change of Kreacher, absolutely everything. I kept waiting and waiting to be disappointed and yes, I was disappointed on the occasion, but the thrill far outweighed the flaws. As for Snape? One of the characters I fell absolutely in love with? THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER.Snape..................Snape dies. He dies working for Dumbledore. He dies, looking into Harry's eyes. He dies because for the last thirty years of his life, he has loved Lily Evans and everything he has done and everything he sacrificed was for her. His death provoked a number of emotions in me and one of the major ones was utter, utter grief. He's been abused and used his whole life, whether by his parents, by his classmates, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, and I felt such freaking anger that in the end, he wasn't even given the proper funeral that he totally deserved. In the book itself, it made sense, because whatever Snape did for the Greater Good, he was still a bastard. But as a reader, my heart broke into ittybitty pieces over him. There were tons of other things going on at the same time. I say, Rowling is an excellent action scene writer. I'm terrible at writing action that's vivid and engaging, but she managed to do it. Harry himself lives. But he's been forever scarred by his experience. And that, actually, is one of the best parts of his book. He was such an arse in books 5 and 6, and to have this mature young man emerge was one of the greatest joys in this series. I was so, so, so happy that he got the happiness he wanted. The ending was much WTF? for me, since it was like a SOOPER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ending, but at the same time... Harry is finally happy and that means a great deal to me. Well. Harry, I've been a fan for almost ten years and in those ten years, you've made me laugh, cry, scream, whoop, run around, obsess, tender, hard, awesome and about a million other things. I've watched you grow from a scared, unsure first year into a hopeful young man in the third and fourth, an angsty teen in the fifth and sixth, and in the seventh? You came full circle and you were as your parents were. Happy, with children of your own. You changed so much and it felt like I had grown up partly with you, though I was but fourteen years old when I read you. I love all of the characters, I love all the books, and well? R.I.P. Severus Snape. You'll be missed. Same with you, Fred, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Colin, Scrimgoeur, Bellatrix, Peter, yes, even Voldemort. A lifetime has passed and HP is going to be one of those books that'll stay with me forever. So... peace out, Harry! You deserve out!

 4+ out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and supposedly final book in 2007 by J.K. Rowling. But then ""Cursed Child"" came out last year... so is a series really over? Not in our hearts and minds, my friends... neither shall this one be... and although I considered spending a huge part of today drafting a very thorough review of Harry Potter, my instincts kicked in and told me not to do so... instead, let's meet up and talk about it somewhere if you want to get into the details. I literally don't have the ability to write everything I am thinking about when it comes to these books... and I wrote my first novel in less than 3 months with not a stitch of writer's block.Sometimes things just flow out of your creativity and into the world's waiting and willing hands. And that's exactly what's happened with the HP book series. It's the kind of book where you can read it at any age and feel a deep connection. You can re-read it and watch the movie all in the same day and never be bored or feel the need to do anything else. When HP movies are running on TV back-to-back over a weekend, I always catch a few of them.These characters are wonderful. The plot is just brilliant. And in this last book, when all the surprises burst from within our own little goblet of fire, we find true nirvana in a set of books unlike any other. From drama to shock, sadness to beauty, Deathly Hallows re-invents the construct of an emotional roller-coaster. Whether you read the whole series or just picked up the last one, you feel the power inside the text... especially when you consider it all started with an innocent and scared little boy who lived under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive.We are all Harry Potter at one point in our lives or during the course of his life. Could be when you were a child searching for someone to love you, or it may be now as an adult looking back on the differences you faced in the eyes of good versus evil. Whatever the connection is, you'll feel it until you are no more... and while this may seem like an exaggeration or a rather ethereal point of view... one thing I know is true:We all make the exact same face when we hear or think of anything to do with his amazing story: there's a brief pause, our lips curl, our eyes roll back a little as we shut out lids, our breath thins out towards the back of our throat, and our hearts all decide it's OK to stop beating for just that 1 second. And in our collective sigh of ""I love Harry Potter"" exclamations, we are all for once, connected by a shared intense feeling that might be strong enough to fuel the world's future.

I don't know what it was about that, but I was sobbing and had tears streaming down my face. When they describe putting the socks on his feet, that was the part that opened the floodgates. I am one of those people that supports the theory that socks are a very imporant symbol in the Harry Potter series. I even did a report in one of my high school English classes on it. ""Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf's bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling his batlike ears."" Rowling, master of subtle detail, still includes that brief mention of socks. It was that which really did me in.Another thing that impressed me was how well the story flowed. Probably a combination of being a good writer and knowing, without a doubt, where the story was going and what she wanted to have happen allowed Rowling to keep the story smooth and not jerky. So easily, especially in the beginning/middle chapters in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for Horcruxes things could have become so choppy. And while time did pass quickly in brief sections it still flowed. A lot of writers, even good writers, can't seem to make something like that work, yet Rowling did, proving herself yet again.I was also really impressed by her ballsy moves of killing off several main characters, especially right in the beginning. I thought it was going to be in the big final battle ('cause c'mon, you knew it was coming) that we lost all our favorites, not within the first few chapters. RIP Hedwig and Mad-Eye. That was one major way you got sucked in because you're thinking, ""Oh my God! Characters I love are already dying! What the-"" and then you keep going because you need to know if anyone else is going to kick it. For some reason though Rowling just loves killing off my favorite characters, Dumbledore, Moody, Fred (and George too in a way), Lupin, Tonks. I was especially angry over the Lupin/Tonks death. It felt like a sort of snub because, yay they're married! Yay, they're having a baby! Yay, he's a little metamorphmagus. Boo, both parents are suddenly dead. Rude. But I guess it made the whole thing hurt a lot more, and it did.Honestly, I felt Rowling tied things up beautifully and not in that harried, ""Oh yeah about that? Um... this happens! Yeah, that's it!"" I think many fans feel vindicated (i.e. the Snape/Lily shippers, those who thought Harry was a Horcrux, don't mess with Mrs. Weasley) after reading this book. Of course there are probably some who are broken down and upset that what they thought was going to happen didn't. In the end we all got one hell of a story and went on one fantastic adventure. No matter what happened, no matter who died or who ended up with who this book was more than I could have hoped for, I was not disappointed at all.All I can say now is: Jo, thank you.

Umm... it's understandable. It has to be done to kill the Voldemort completely. But I didn't feel good. It was good that Harry didn't die. And Mrs. Rowling handled this fact reasonably.=> The Tale of Three Brothers was interesting.=> Action scenes were pretty vivid. I still remember them.=> I was expecting that Nagini would be killed by Harry but not. It's okay by the way.=> Epilogue seemed to me J. K. Rowling had in mind that sometime later she would again start this series.
 BEST BOOK OF THE SERIES
I enjoyed them almost equally. There is very, very minor difference in my liking:1. Prisoner of Azkaban2. Goblet of Fire3. Deathly Hallows4. Half-Blood Prince5. Chamber of Secrets6. Sorcerer's Stone7. Order of PhoenixI just wanted to do this. But in short I adore every book of this series.So that's it! I have finished this series. I am happy. For now I don't have plans, at all, to re-read books because I think there is a very little time and there are sooo many books I want to read very much. But IF I ever will plan to re-read books, then this series, for sure, and Artemis Fowl series will be the one which I will choose to read.Both are unique in their own accord. I wanted to do the comparison but it's useless. I always end up liking both equally. 1st position is given to HP because of J. K. Rowling's writing style which is indeed magical.Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl are my fictional friends. I will never forget the time I have spent with them.Bye bye...Harry Potter! 😭😭 Bye bye...Ron! 😭😭June 9, 2017

I never thought they would, but it sure as hell was an exciting notion. However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that this book is darker and the lack of humour makes for a depressing hundred pages around pg200.The deaths... a little weird how the human deaths are less effective, maybe that's just me but Hedwig and Dobby's deaths broke my heart. With mad-eye... well, he was an asshole so i didn't care. With Fred... well, there is another one so the impact is lessened. With Lupintonks... well if they were stupid enough to name Harry godfather (even THEY should have seen the parellalism!) then they deserve to die. No i don't mean that, but as we didn't see them die it seems less horrifying.So much more interesting and original than the others this daring new direction led to some bad writing which didn't go anywhere in the end (wtf was the hallows about?).The Hallows was a ridiculous idea and frankly i was horrified that Rowling was attempting to introduce such a 'major' theme in the last book with only one brief reference in book six. They were pointless, in the end what did it matter who had ownership of the elder wand? no one used it in 'the final duel' anyway.I no longer like Dumbledore, JK dragged him through the mud and didn't thoroughly wash him off. Harry forgave him but i sure as hell didn't (and who didn't see the 'Harry is a Horcrux' thing coming?The chapter 'King's cross' made me cry. But not because it was well written, rather the opposite, it didn't make sense at times (where the hell were they?) i had to reread the section on harry's 'phoenixlike' ability several times and i still hate it. It was so weak. This sequence was nothing like the other 'endofbookharryanddumbledore' explanations we have come to know and love. Nothing was explained in this chapter everything was re-explained and slightly embellished. The chapters immediately preceding this were the real treat of the book, Snape is finally redeemed (although after ten years of waiting i did expect a better ironclad reason for trusting him than loving lily). Harry facing his mortality is heartbreaking even though most of us have imagined it countless times. The moment right before his death is about as perfect an HP moment there is. He should have stayed dead and the narration flick to another.Voldemort's Invincible Army is defeated too easily and Bellatrix's death is unsatisfying as Molly has no real motive for revenge (nono Fred's death doesn't count). Harry should have done it. He also should have performed at least one killing curse in the book, he performed the other unforgivables, so why not?Voldemort is killed by a reflecting spell.What?WHAT?Are you KIDDING me?Could it possibly be more anticlimactic?What was the point of the elder wand then? Why the elaborate buildup when Harry doesn't even perform the execution?Anyone could have duelled to a reflection, and since when can that happen?A true HP fan must take alot on faith to enjoy this ending.The less said about the epilogue the better. Probably been written since book one and it shows. There is no depth, any hp fan could guess (or assume) this ending, its not even worth reading. Albus Severus was the only icing on this unsatisfying and dry cake.If you do read this book close it at the end of 'the forest again' and write your own ending.OR wait for JK to realise her mistake and re publish with an alternate ending.This was not a rant.Update: Look. I gave it four stars okay?

Hagrid carrying Harry at that crucial moment... A special mention must go to the following part, which CRACKED me up:“Our Headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.Complaints... I have a few. Don’t get me wrong, the crazy amounts of twists and turns surrounding the horcruxes and hallows are enthralling but at times I do find myself pausing to think - especially when it comes to the ownership of the elder wand - but I think that’s just me?! I also find this book has a different feel to the others since we’re not really in Hogwarts... which makes me sad :(Although a major complaint I have is that such an important and crucial character, and one that I love, has an off-page death (I’m trying not to be spoilery here... just incase). WHAT THE HECK! It’s just kinda mentioned in passing and I’m sure on my first read my eyes were just bugging outta my head!!However such complaints can’t take away from what I find to be a fitting end to the series. Sure, you feel like Rowling is pummelling your heart to a bloody pulp... but would you have it any other way? I’m missing my reread already, and I'm considering rewatching the movies as I’m just not ready to leave Hogwarts just yet.All was well. 5 stars!

He also took special interest in killing Harry Potter whose main mission for the book would be not to die long enough to fulfill the mission given to him by Dumbledore in the previous book, thus no Hogwarts studies this time; it is about stayin' alive for Harry:Something I noticed again during my reread of the series, especially this book: J.K. Rowling is not at all shy about killing her characters, especially good ones. George R.R. Martin often gets all the slack for doing thisbut despite Harry Potter's author saying that she feels bad about killing good people, a great number of them died in the series (and outside it if you start counting from Harry's parents). Some of these deaths are still as tragic on the second time around. Harry's gradual discovery of Dumbledore as not-quite-good-guy is brilliant. It took me two reads to grasp all the nuances of this. Now for the bad parts which unfortunately made me reduce otherwise perfect rating by one star. Ron - to use his favorite word - is a git, especially in this book. He was destined to remain forever in Harry's shadow, but this is exactly the place he deserved. He did not do anything exciting on his own since fated chess match in the first (!) book. As a character Ginny Weasley cannot be even compared to Luna Lovegood, not to mention Hermione Granger. If Harry could not get Hermione, I hoped he ended up with Luna - sure she is loony at times, but she is always understanding, brave, and smart; read carefully her parts if you do not believe me. She was able to help Harry more than Ginny whose only help was kissing him a couple of times. The forest sequence of the book was way too long. This is probably the only part of the series which felt drown out. The whole epilogue feels off. I understand the need to show happily ever afterbut it still feels out of place. So as I mentioned with these complaints I have to reduce the rating by one, reluctantly. The whole series however deserved unconditional perfect rating. If you have not read it because you think this is for children or because it is too mainstream, or because you think it offends your religious beliefs - get off your high horseand head to your nearest library for the magical experience.

I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I smiled, and when it was all over I just sat there and contemplated what my life will be like now that I have finished the series once more. I highly recommend this series more than anything else in the world to those who need some magic in their lives, which is virtually everyone. Love conquers all, and without delving too much into spoilers, that is where I will leave this. Please pick up this series if you have not, I promise it will not disappoint.This next portion is a little bit into my history with Harry Potter, to better understand how I come up with my thoughts about this series. The first time I read the Harry Potter series I was 13 years old. Now, that may seem a bit older than most when they started reading this miraculous series, but I was skeptical to the power that these books had on so many. Although I was older than most when I first read this series, I was also still pretty young and could really only relate to Harry and the others up to about the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban, when they were 13, like I was. Now, exactly five years later, I have been every age (other than in '19 Years Later'), that Harry, Hermione, and Ron have been throughout the entire series, which I think benefits me greatly in understanding their thoughts, feelings, and decisions in each book. When I first read the books, I knew that I could never love anything more, and now, five years later, I am even more sure that this series will not only stay with me forever, bring me light in my darkest days, and be passed on to my children, but also that I have not felt this way about anything. It might seem silly, but I think when one finds this in something, they know, whether or not others will understand. I will most certainly be rereading this series in the future many more times and will continue to be astounded with the growth that I see in myself as I get older, but also with this series, because as I change, it changes with me. It would be a dishonour to give this anything less than 5 stars! Infinity out of 5!

As we enter the final formal novel in the series, J.K. Rowling takes readers on an adventure like no other. This is the plot line that series fans have been waiting to see play out over six previous novels. Harry Potter prepares for his final clash with Lord Voldemort, where only one can survive. Good versus Evil if ever there was a clear and symbolic interaction. Rowling develops a story unlike the previous pieces, where a scholastic year serves as the story’s undertone. Rather, this book reads more like a journey from a fantasy novel, with various creatures met along the way, precious items are discovered, and an epic battle proves to be the climatic moment in the narrative. Full of action and sorrow, Rowling does not skimp out here and keeps her fans glued to the page until the final sentence is done, but even then it lingers!After a long time waiting, Harry can finally see the age of seventeen before him. After the numerous calamities from the end of the Sixth Year, Harry is ready to fulfil the prophecy and will begin a journey to defeat Lord Voldemort, protecting good from the clutches of his evil ways. After those troublesome Durselys reluctantly agree to go into hiding, keeping the Death Eaters from preying on them, Harry sets off with Ron and Hermione to locate some of the other horcruxes about which Dumbledore spoke before his murder. The desctruction of these horcruxes is the only way to ensure that Voldemort can be killed once and for all.After a plan to get Harry to safety by using a number of doppelgängers goes awry, there is some doubt if it is all worth it. However, there is no second-guessing the plan and the three forge ahead. If tackling the quest were not enough, rumours about Dumbledore’s past emerge in a tell-all biography that offers more dirt than glory for Hogwarts’ former headmaster. Harry begins to wonder just how well he knew the man and whether there was a dark side to him that was shielded. There are many pitfalls and struggler that Ron, Hermione, and Harry face, which leads to struggles and painful realizations. Ron’s temper is frayed when he feels he’s been duped and he flees, returning home.Harry and Hermione are crestfallen that their closest friend has abandoned them and seek answers in Godric’s Hollow. Voldemort almost obliterates them there, leaving the two to feel as though the Dark Lord is anticipating their every move. What’s worse, Harry’s wand is broken in the skirmish, leaving them without proper protection at the worst possible moment. There’s little left to protect these two, other than their wits, which are growing shorter by the moment.Weeks later, another clash takes place and Harry is almost killed. His savour is none other than an apologetic Ron, who arrives just in time. Using Gryffindor’s sword, the three are able to destroy another horcrux and they become enlightened about the provenance of a mysterious trio of magical objects called the Deathly Hallows. Anyone who possesses all three items is said to ‘own’ death, which may be one way to guarantee defeating Voldemort. However, it is not as easy as it sounds, something to which Harry has become accustomed over the last while.While Harry inches closer to an ultimate clash, he realises that he may have to sacrifice everything to save others. As heroic as it sounds, it is rare for someone of seventeen to sober to this so easily. Will Harry agree to die in order to save others? Can he stomach a life without himself around, even if it means Voldemort dies as well? Dumbledore’s prophecies all come together and Harry must soldier on, forgetting what others have said. A chance encounter with a spirit form of Dumbledore opens Harry’s mind to new truths.The final standoff is set, with Harry and Voldemort facing off. No others can interfere and there is little that can be solved by talking. Harry has made his choice, for his friends, his family, and himself. Death no longer scares him, if it means others can rest peacefully. It’s time for a spell like no other... and perhaps some luck from Merlin’s beard!This series definitely increased in its intensity as things progressed. J.K. Rowling offers her readers something that is less a story in this final novel, but more of an epic adventure that pushes the series into the realm of fantasy (not that it was teetering before). The complex nature of this story shows a deeper set of themes that the mature reader will readily understand. A friend of mine commented that Rowling definitely wrote these latter novels with the expectation that her reader had matured, as Harry did, and would be able to comprehend the nuances. While I am not sure Neo caught some of it, I know he appreciated the action and detail, as he spoke with me about it once I had read enough not to hush him.Harry Potter retains the role of protagonist, but is also the ‘good’ for all that can be found within this book. With this on his shoulders, Harry must come to terms with the realization that he is the only one who can fend off Lord Voldemort. Like a teenage Jesus, Harry cannot turn away from this fate, even if he questions it from time to time. Harry has moved from being a young boy with a mysterious scar to the only thing left to save the world from the clutches of evil. As dramatic as it sounds, series fans will likely agree as they synthesise the growth Harry has made along the way. Still, there are moments of teenage ‘normalcy’ as he urns for love and acceptance, as well as wanting to turn away and let someone else handle the heavy lifting.Rowling has developed her supporting characters throughout the series, allowing the reader to choose those they favour and hiss and the folks that are best left outside the tent. However, in an epic novel such as this, it is time to cull the herd, so to say. While Rowling injects as much magic into them as she can with her written word, she also leaves some to perish and forced the reader to process this for themselves. There are many faces who have made an impact who return, almost in a cameo manner, and Rowling flavours the narrative with their interactions. Series fans will likely revel in all that is provided here, though there will surely be some whose passing will not be readily accepted by the larger reading community.This was a highly complex and multilayered novel, understandably so. There is a general journey theme that serves as a story arc, but also smaller revelations in each chapter. Plot lines merge or blur, depending on what Rowling wants to do, but the final goal is clear throughout. Harry’s maturation comes to a head and the final battle will surely draw clear lines.Easily the most mentally consuming of all the novels, I could not allow myself a moment to rest as I tried to make sense of the threads that weave together. The younger reader is soon sobered to truths that things are not always going to be positive, where good is sure to triumph over evil. That being said, there is a ray of hope, albeit faint at times.Rowling has waited until the seventh novel to really pull out all the stops. The symbolism of Good versus Evil is not lost on many, though I am sure some would have liked something a tad more nuanced. It is war and Harry must realise that Voldemort is not one to stand down, but to rectify what he family to do on Hallowe’en night 1981. Rowling dazzles with her intricate narrative that weaves together a strong story and provides countless adventures in well-developed chapters. I cannot say enough about the piece and am pleased to have undertaken this reading challenge. While the formal books and done and I have a sense of where things have gone, there’s still a stage-play, a Book 8, to conquer. I will return to audio for that, as I am not sure I could wait to find a production of it. Kudos, Madam Rowling, for keeping me enthralled throughout. I’ve loved this journey, as it brought me closer to my son, some of my dearest friends, and helped me tap into a part of myself I never knew existed.Love/hate the review?

Severus taught me to never, ever judge a person. Hagrid taught me that anything can be good with the right perspective.Ginny taught me that bold is beautiful. Neville taught me that courage is standing up for what is right, even if you're terrified. Luna taught me that being different from others isn't a bad thing.Dobby taught me that freedom is a gift.Molly taught me that a happy family is not measured in gold.Tonks taught me to love myself, no matter what I look like.Dumbledore taught me not to be afraid of speaking up and that I can achieve anything I want as long as I choose to work for it. J.K Rowling taught me that stories we love will be with us...always.These 7 books made me angry, sad, happy, intrigued, upset and delighted and for this I am grateful.All was indeed well.

Harry is now 17, which means the protective charm that has kept him safe till now has expired. Voldemort is stronger than ever, not only is he wreaking havoc in the wizarding world but even the Muggles know that there is an evil surrounding them.Harry, Hermione and Ron have the difficult job of leaving behind their loved ones to continue the mission Dumbledore left Harry. What should have been their seventh year at Hogwarts is instead a hunt for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. “I'm going to keep going until I succeed — or die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.”Deathly Hallows is everything I could have wanted in a series finale. It ties off Harry's story so well. The change of setting, the character growth, plot twists and heists — is what makes this book stand out compared to the others. Every single part of this book was just so well thought out. I can distinctly remember reading it as a kid completely in awe of this story. I still am. Despite the heartbreaking deaths of some of my favourite characters; every time I turn the last page I do it with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes. 
“You'll stay with me?”“Until the very end,” said James.

 This is my favourite Harry Potter book, I adore it, I love it so much. It's weird because it's not /usual/ Harry Potter. It doesn't have much Hogwarts, there's no quidditch -- but I love it I don't wanna get gushy about Harry Potter I mean you all feel me on this everyone loves Harry Potter, you get me. I'm just gonna list some reasons I love this book, this series, so much. - The characters.  I just want it to be on the record Harry James Potter is one of my top five favourite characters. He is just SUCH A GOOD PERSON. I admire his bravery, his selflessness and his determination ( and also he's literally the most savage person his roasts are life ) I love so much about him - I love that he's not perfect either. He can be mean, arrogant, literally annoying asf but I LOVE HIM. He makes me so emotional, like he actually breaks my heart. Thats why this book is actual crack for me. There is so much of it relating to Harry's parents, his past, his childhood. There is so much about him having to do the right thing even though it's hard, even though he's suffering, even though people have literally been fucking with him for years he does the right thing anyway I JUST LOVE HIM ALOT Other characters, Ron man. Ron. He fucks up bad but he comes back and he redeems himself and urggh I love him. His loyalty is amazing, but he's such a real character. I love how he (quite literally) is able to conquer (stab with a sword) his demons and his character development is amazing and he's just so funny and such a good friend he's my son ?? I love him. HERMIONE I honestly can't say anything except wife me she's so inspirational and passionate and sticks to her beliefs even when they're unpopular and I honestly just love her and the trio so much ?Deathly Hallows is just so good like lets recap on some highlights.  --> Opens on Dudley actually accepting Harry and thanking him --> Wild broom chase, crazy sky wand fights and I'm Holey Fred ... get it ? --> Ron fighting his mother about the wedding. Harry and Ginny. Horcrux planning.  --> Coffee shop death eater skirmish --> REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK --> Lily's letter --> KREACHER --> Ministry break-in. Harry sticking it to Umbridge --> Potterwatch --> GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN ?!?! --> The DA resisting in Hogwarts, magical graffiti that says Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting! --> Speaking of Dumbledore, just the entirely of his and Aberforths family story --> Godrics Hollow. Harry seeing James & Lily's graves and the house. Heartbreaking but beautiful --> THE BIT WHEN NEVILLE WIPES OUT NAGINI --> Snape's story --> Everything coming together so beautifully at the end aND THE GRAND HALL SCENE --> Harry mending the Phoenix wand  --> Teddy Lupin existing --> Harry getting to see his parents/Sirius/Lupin say what he's always wanted to crying bye --> like the whole book tbh ?? I love it ??I could say alot about the beautiful messages and sybolism. I could say about the beautiful and poignant way Harry's grief and loss about his parents is dealt with, or talk about the perfect symbolism of Voldermort's death - and how it shows that he was not special but just a regular man who was devoid of love and took his quest for power way too far. I could talk about how Voldermort's soul is represented and what Voldermort represents for humanity but I wouldn't be the first and I won't be the last and I would have too much to say anyway (and no way to say it how I wanna)So instead I'll just say I adore this book, forever and always. I adore this series and everything it gave me. I love that it created such a wonderful and expansive world I wanna live in. I love that it gave me characters who were my friends growing up. I love that it's defined my childhood and become to important to me and I can't believe it came out nearly ten years ago. I love it so much, forever.

Especially since we get such a nice close-up of our favorite villain!Just what is the connection between the Obscurials and the Deatheaters, anyway? Oddly suspicious, no? And Ariana Dumbledore? I really need to know how Grindelwald's darkness leads to the informing of Voldemort's powers. :)Okay! Maybe I really ought to talk about the book? I liked it better this time than the first time. A lot. It helps to have EXPLANATIONS over the movies, no matter how pretty all the action scenes are. :) It sounds like a recurring theme, no? Well, there are things that books do so much better than any other medium, and when it comes to UNDERSTANDING, it's peerless.I didn't nearly get so annoyed at the absolutely nothing happening sections in the tale, either, unlike in the movie, because I was actually invested in all those little side characters this time. I wanted to know what was on the radio. It's kinda odd, no? The worst parts the first time around turn out to be some of the best if you CARE. :) Well, this time, I did, and I guess that's what makes a fanboy. Or a Potterhead. No?

This review contains spoilers.2011 REVIEW - 2ND READINGI made a promise to myself that I wouldn't read my review from 2007, when the book first came out, until after I'd published this one. I want to see how they compare - what thoughts/reactions etc. had changed, if any, and any additional insights - but it does make me nervous, because I reckon my first review will prove to be much better written - and what if I seem dumber this time around? I find I get a bit muddled from watching the films, too, in that after watching them I can't remember if bits were in the book or the film and vice versa. Oh well. Really must stop over-thinking things! [Scroll down for my first review, from 2007.]The final Harry Potter book always looks too short to me, like, how could everything possibly be wrapped up in a book that's not as long as The Order of the Phoenix, when there's still so much to do?! I felt that the first time, and I felt that again. But once again I admire Rowling's skill in crafting a tremendous story and a powerful ending for what is to me one of the best fantasy series out there. There's a lot going on in this novel, but it's nicely balanced with quieter, slower parts and you really get that last chance to really know Harry, Ron and Hermione. Rowling never lets plot overpower her characters or her story, and she won't be rushed: the pacing is steady and consistent throughout, which only adds to the tension-filled scenes where you start biting your nails.This is a book that makes me cry, and I'll tell you why - in a bit. I wondered how I could share all the things I love about this particular book, and figured listing them was probably the best option. 	 Hedwig dying. I had completely forgotten, and it's so, so sad. I like how they did it for the movie, giving her a role and using her as a visual means of identifying Harry, since in the book it's more complicated. 	 Hermione erasing her existence - removing knowledge and memory of herself from her parents' minds and sending them off to Australia under new identities so that they aren't a target. There is something incredibly tragic about this, though it doesn't get much attention. I can't imagine the kind of strength and resolve it would take to do that, though the realities of the world would probably help give you the resolve. 	 Kreacher becoming an ally. And all for an act of genuine kindness (Harry gives him ""Master Regulus'"" locket after hearing his story). And what he was made to do for Voldemort. Nothing, not even Kreacher, is black and white, and that's an important lesson to learn. He betrayed Sirius at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, but when you learn more about him, you realise it's not a simple matter at all. 	 Dobby's death. He was such a brave, selfless elf, and as characters, he and Kreacher really brought into sharp relief the whole issue of house elves and their mistreatment. 	 The mortality of the Weasley's. Until this book, they always struck me as one of those solid features who come close to utter tragedy but always manage to avoid it, like with Arthur getting attacked by the snake. Here, though, George loses an ear and, at the end, Fred is killed. Fred's death is one of the saddest things for me.  	 Likewise, Lupin and Tonks' deaths at the final battle - I remember reading that the first time and feeling that sense of utter disbelief. I felt it again here, like someone had surely made a mistake, especially when Harry sees their bodies next to Fred and their described as sleeping. But with a newborn left behind, and the fact that Lupin only recently found the first real happiness he's ever known - to have that cut short, it makes me want to cry just typing this. The deaths of these characters had a much bigger impact on me than the death of Dumbledore - as big a surprise as that was on first reading - at the end of The Half-Blood Prince. In a way, Dumbledore had to go so that Harry could come into his own. But these characters, their deaths are so needless, and they were too young and left too much behind. 	 Snape's love for Lily. I knew there was a good reason why we forgave Snape at the end, but I was glad I couldn't remember exactly what it was. Snape is another complex character, who shows that it's not a simple matter of right or wrong, good or evil. He's not someone to be judged at face value or first impressions, though obviously that's what everyone has been doing all his life. It's not even pity that I felt for him, but empathy at losing the woman he loved and sacrificing everything in memory of her. He never stopped loving her. Timeless love. No wonder Dumbledore trusted him implicitly: he understood the power of such emotions and never dismissed them as insignificant. 	 The truth about Dumbledore's past, and his sister Ariana. So sad. I haven't seen the second half of the movie version yet but I hope they include these details. 	 Harry walking to his impending death, supported by the ghosts of his parents, Sirius and Lupin. I cried when James and Lily and Cedric appeared at the end of The Goblet of Fire, and they had no less power here, bolstering their son and being there so he wasn't alone as he went to Voldemort, knowing he was going to be killed - and not knowing that he would survive it.  	 The dragon kept imprisoned in Gringott's Bank. I felt so bad for the poor tortured beast, and so happy when they freed it. 	 Xenophilius Lovegood. The position he was in, having his daughter taken away and used as a threat against him, to betray his beliefs (i.e., in Harry as the Chosen One). 	 Petunia Dursley, Harry's aunt, is a sad figure in her own right. It becomes clear in this book why she was so anti-magic: she was jealous of her sister Lily's ability. The scene where Lily mentions that Petunia wrote to Dumbledore, asking to be let into Hogwarts, and Petunia's feelings of embarrassment and shame and longing, of feeling excluded - you can't help but feel for the little girl who grew into a resentful woman in denial.  There's lots of happy things here too, like Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding and Ron and Hermione finally getting together, as well as great mini-adventures that all lead up to the final show-down. The plan to get into the Ministry of Magic, and later the Gringott's Bank break-in, for example, were really fun and exciting and scary. And one of my favourite scenes is the Neville Longbottom snake-killing scene - really, I just love all the Neville scenes but that one in particular really stuck in my head all the intervening years since first reading it.And underlying it all is this Hitler-like race and class war that Voldemort is enacting. Muggles and Mud-bloods become demonised and terrorised and everyone has to prove their ""purity"". The film captured this really well in the set design, especially inside the Ministry.I loved that there was so much I couldn't remember when I started this book - I couldn't remember what the Hallows were, or what was inside the Snitch, or how they found the other Horcruxes. I had forgotten Dobby died until I watched the film a few months ago. It was wonderful to read it almost like it was the first time.And then there's the epilogue - I'll mention it because I remember how much fans railed against it when the book first came out. I'm still not sure why, except maybe it wasn't up to the standards of the rest of the series. I read somewhere that Rowling wrote it at the beginning, which is kinda cool, and shows just how well she planned it all out. The line that I love is this one, where Harry tells his son: ""Albus Severus, [...] you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."" [p.607] It gets me every time.2007 REVIEW - 1ST READINGSo, there were huge expectations - and quite a few bets, debates and demands - for this last book, and personally I thought it was a great ending to the series. One of the things that I love about these books, that has always impressed me, is how tightly plotted they are, how detailed. Others have complained about the plotholes in Deathly Hallows, but I didn't see any. Granted, I wasn't looking for them, and I didn't succeed in my intention to re-read the previous books before this one (managed Philosopher's Stone but left it too late for the others) so I had forgotten some details. Deathly Hallows made me laugh, made me cry (seriously, I bawled - and there were no tissues at the cottage so had to mop my face with paper towel...), had me pressing my knuckles to my mouth (the closest I come to biting my nails), and kept me on the edge of my seat. What more could you ask for? Quite a few characters die in this book, but everyone knew there would be some deaths because Rowling said there would be. She's also said, apparently, that the books are about death, though, having read the last book, I understand now that she doesn't mean they're about death, but about death. The whole idea behind The Boy Who Lived was that his mother's sacrifice protected him from the killing curse, and when Harry in turn sacrifices himself, he protects everyone at Hogwarts (where all the characters assemble for the big show-down) from Lord Voldemort. I also liked how the death of Dumbledore (in the previous book) and Snape's betrayal are resolved; I liked that Snape did it all for love of Lily, Harry's mother. It worked, brought out the humanity that has always lurked deep beneath Snape's corrosive veneer. The saddest deaths were of Fred, one of the Weasley twins, and Lupin and Tonks, only weeks after the birth of their baby. Is it any wonder that I cried? And even though there was always the hope that Harry would survive, still the section leading up to his sacrifice was written so convincingly, so non-melodrammatically, that I actually had to put the book down for a minute and do a quick turn about the house to calm myself down a bit. The only bit that looked like a glaring plothole at first was when Neville pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat to lop Voldemort's snake's head off with. That confused me - last we saw of the sword, the goblin had taken it and disappeared into the depths of Gringotts with it. Then I remembered: Harry had pulled the sword out of the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets, too. The last lingering doubt is why the hat was on fire and why exactly Voldemort wanted to non-sort them then and there. Ah well, it works for dramatic effect! Another part of the book which has received a lot of flak: the epilogue. Saccharine, it's been described. I have to agree, and it's the only bit of saccharine in the entire series. Apparently it was written way back in the 90s, but I don't think that excuses it. It was like icing on the cake - sickly sweet, not at all filling or satisfying, hiding the cake beneath which is what you really want to eat, as long as you can have the icing too. So we learn how they paired up and what their kids' names are, that Neville is a Herbology professor and, well, very little else. Noticeably, Harry's conversation with Dumbledore in King's Cross Station shows how much Harry has grown and matured. He's moved through his teenage angst and become reliable, responsible, thoughtful, more patient. By not going after the Deathly Hallows, his first impulse is tempered by a new, cooler head. Aside from the humour, reminiscent of Roald Dahl, and the plotting, the character development of Harry is another reason why the books are so enjoyable, and long-lasting.

It wrecks your soul and then it puts it all back together... James. Albus Severus. Lily. Hugo. Rose.I was crying because it just occurred to me that Harry, Ron and Hermione were like 11 in the first book and ended up having kids and being in their late 30's which at this point I had lost my shit and crying and did not know what to do with myself.
“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”
I just want to say that Harry Potter taught me to be brave and love rather than hate and not being afraid of even dying for those I love. Harry chose to be the better man and he defeated Voldemort not with power but with bravery and courage that only love can armor you with. He fought with friends by his side. Loved ones.

[Warning: spoilers ahead but names withheld where possible]The Deathly Hallows was a fantastic, explosive ending to the incredible Harry Potter series. All the work Rowling did to build this story over nearly 3000 pages to reach this climax is quite an accomplishment. The tension between the quest we learned of in Half-Blood Prince for the horcruxes and that we learn in the beautiful fable of the eponymous Deathly Hallows is spectacular. The whole book resonates with dark energy - the attack on wizarding society by Voldemort's minion's honestly reminds me of the unholy alliance of the ammosexual christofascist right and Trump especially in the massive hypocrisy involved - and is extremely well-written throughout. Overall thoughts on the series: I really liked how Rowling dealt with the janus-type themes of racism and acceptance. The horrors of Voldemort's followers tortures and murders of the semi- and non-magical peoples is a frightening reminder of both the Shoah and of slavery in America. On the other hand, the composition of Team Harry with misfits and a relatively decent amount of female protagonists was a fantastic way to discuss diversity. Sub-themes about freedom of the press, the loss of innocence, the failing of illusions of youth...all of these are treated with delicate precision. That is perhaps what I appreciate most about Rowling's universe - besides the relatively solid consistency from end to end as well as fantastic characters that one wishes they could meet in real life (Hagrid!), there are also subtle and not so subtle calls to a basic pagan morality that doesn't need to call out to the Bible (like in A Wrinkle in Time) or biblical analogies (Narnia). That being said, it is fascinating how she built her Potterverse with a mixture of Greek (centaurs, phoenixes) and Hindu (Nagini is like the Naga of the Churning of the Sea of Milk story) mythologies. She demonstrates a wide-ranging curiosity and creative power of merging various traditions into her own unique fabric which feels familiar and less foreign than, say, the Tolkien universe.Deathly Hallows was certainly a worthy place for Rowling to end the legacy of Harry's time at Hogwarts and is a true literary achievement in writing for children and adolescents.

I mean, after one such incident, there's a line that says something like, How they managed to escape from such a situation was beyond him ... yeah, that's because it's a freakin' novel.3. What the fuck was up with that chapter with Dumbledore? It's like JK Rowling was trying too hard to make this book more than the good story it should have been.4. Draco was ignored, explained away as a just a contrived plot point.5. Ron leaving and then coming back to save Harry - contrived plot point.6. Ron and Hermione finally kissing ... in the middle of a war ... in the middle of a hallway that's about to fall apart ... ... sure, that's going to happen.7. Who the fuck cares about the characters that did die? I mean, only the Weasely twin was someone important.8. And of course Hedwig died. Harry couldn't have a way to communicate with the Wizarding world now could he.9. Lord Voldemort has been foiled by Harry how many times now? And when he ""kills"" Harry, don't you think that a wizard mastermind who's been foiled by this stupid boy as many times as he had, would go make sure the little prat is dead himself? Like he'd go poke him with his wand or something?10. Hermione, in every other book, has had some sort of thing that only she can figure out, but in this book she suddenly becomes this little wussy girl that lets Harry walk all over her.--It took me FOUR days to read this book. FOUR!!! I - little miss read the HP books in ten hours straight - put this book down volutarily for three nights in a row. It took all my self-discipline not to throw it across the room.There were two redeeming parts of this book. Just two.1. At the Malfoy's when Ron is screaming for Hermione.2. The chapter about Snape.That's it.And the Epilogue sucked.

Death Eater Shocker! Arch-villain Forgets to take Glock 9mm to Final Battle!: ""I don't know what the Dark Lord was thinking. Why didn't he just cap the little guy?!"" - Hogwart's HeraldContentious topics ahead - Read at your own risk!On the plus side JKR has written a final novel for her series that brings together all the threads and emotionally immerses the reader in a series of stunning emotional moments based on devastating losses and utmost bravery.However...The problems I have center around Voldemort and the final battle with Harry. This is the climax of the series as it brings to a close the essential conflict between these two characters which is at the heart of everything.[1] The first problem, Voldemort descends from an intelligent, capable, callous, ruthless, high-functioning psychopath (strong evil) into a witless, delusional madman (a rabid dog).
... Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams; humourless and insane, ... (a page later) ... but now let out a cackle of mad laughter.
JKR is not the only author I've read that posits Evil = Madness. (Here's looking at you Raymond E Feist). This is a convenient and soothing fiction. If evil is a madness, then healthy people wont be evil. If evil is a sickness, then evil could be cured. I've even seen people posit evil as a form of stupidity or ignorance - oh, if it was only that simple we would have cured evil a long time ago.It strikes me that Evil is a fundamentally rational approach to life and far more dangerous as a consequence of that rationality. That is, people who will do evil, do so because it is the most expedient way for them to reach their goals. They just don't care about the negative consequences of their actions on others (lack of empathy, lack of a conscience, lack of compassion, etc).By reducing Voldemort from a highly capable strong evil character to a two-dimensional clownish figure of madness, JKR greatly reduces the threat and tension of this climatic moment.OMG! I lament the lost opportunity JKR had to draw true evil as it is... (Sigh. Such is life, we seemed doomed to live in ignorance...)[2] Voldemort loves the sound of his own voice, and Harry is happy to engage, including telling Voldemort precisely what was about to happen.
... 'because Dumbledore's last plan hasn't backfired on me at all. It's backfired on you, Riddle.'
Indeed, and it is precisely Voldemort's use of the Eldar wand, after being told that it magically belongs to Harry, that he is killed by his own backfiring spell.Given that Voldemort is now a witless madman, his defeat is assured and without surprise.I'm reminded of Tom Riddle in the Chamber of Secrets explaining everything to demonstrate the marvelous cleverness of his evil plan before snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.Gloat speeches - please go away. The Climax was a drawn-out FIZZER and as welcome as a wet blanket on a cold night - deducting 200 points from all houses...The second last word, which will be series wide, I'm giving to one of the characters who seemed to have missed out on a bigger role.The Sorting Hat: ""And why wasn't I considered for the post of Professor? I could teach Defense against the Dark Arts, or Potions. I'd certainly be an improvement on the ghost that teaches the History of Magic. It's discrimination - pure and simple. No one wants a teaching Hat!""And the last word goes to the villain ...Voldemort: ""Things I wasn't allowed to do by the author. [1] Cut Harry's head off after zapping him with an Avada Kedavra spell for the 2nd time. I mean, would you take any chances with the fracking 'boy who lived?' [2] Bring a 9mm automatic to the final battle. [3] Install half a dozen snipers around Hogwarts prior to the final battle - just in case. (Shakes head) I really envy the dragon Smaug, he got to be ""Chiefest of Calamities,"" whereas I was just a mad idiot. What a fracking mess.""3 'Miserable Villain,' stars for this book, and 5 'Wizarding Wheezes,' stars for the series.

When I started reading The Deathly Hallows for the first time, it seemed impossible that J.K. Rowling could wrap up all the unresolved issues and contradictions with her final book. The friends have no idea where to start hunting for horcruxes. Where are they? WHAT are they? And when they figure those things out, how do they destroy them? Dumbledore is gone, so he can’t help. And what the fuck is up with Snape? I am happy to say that, despite my doubts, Rowling did a wonderful job of resolving everything, all the while changing everything I thought to be true. In the first three chapters alone, so much change has happened. Dumbledore is gone, and Harry can’t reconcile the man he thought he knew with all the accusations and doubts flying around. The Malfoys are no longer powerful but instead are being humiliated by their fellow death eaters and by Voldemort. And instead of Harry leaving the Dursleys’ at the end of the summer like always, the Dursleys are running for cover. Even Dudley behaves completely out of character and is nice to and concerned about Harry. What is the world coming to? Voldemort’s return has changed virtually everything.Throughout the book, we get one mind blowing reveal after another which caused me to flip back through previous books and grin at the brilliance of a series that was fully planned from start to finish before book one was ever written. And the changes kept coming. I saw them everywhere: in the behavior of the Ministry, in the loss of characters we adored, and in the revelation of characters we hoped for but were unsure of (I’m looking at you Ron, Dumbledore, Neville, Percy, and Snape). And although I hate to admit it, because I have ignored on principle that the epilogue even exists for many years, I saw them there, too. The orphan boy with no one to love him from the first book is part of a wonderful family he has always wanted, with his trusted friends by his side. What a fantastic way to end this groundbreaking series. Except for his kid’s name. I mean, come on.

Either way, there’s not too much to say here. Is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows perfect? I suppose not. I know some people think the trio spend too much of the middle section tromping through the woods. I know others feel that too much of the story and the plot turn on wand lore. Personally, I wasn't bothered by either of those parts. And in reality, it would have been impossible to satisfy everyone's hopes and expectations for the finale.There are so many gripping, moving sections in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Dudley's redemption. Hedwig. The backstory of Kreacher and Regulus. Godric's Hollow. The Tale of the Three Brothers. Dobby's death and burial. Breaking in and out of Gringotts. And then everything that happens in the last six chapters of the book, especially the Prince's Tale and the final confrontation, which is so much better here than the movie’s version.But in many ways, what sets Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows apart is Harry's learning and understanding that Dumbledore was just a man, powerful but flawed. Symbolically, it completes his transition to adulthood, and leaves him ready to face Voldemort as an equal. Finally learning the details of Dumbledore's past illuminates parts of earlier books, gives him more depth as a character, and in context is even more evidence of Harry's heroic nature.The author may have let people down later in her life; people sometimes suck more than you realize at first. But the Harry Potter series is an achievement that will outlast her and all of us. If somehow you've stubbornly refused to read it, you are really missing out. And Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a wonderful, thoughtful ending to this series.

Many plotlines of previous books are barely touched upon (S.P.E.W.) or ""resolved"" in an entirely dissatisfactory manner (Grawp, though I wasn't unhappy about not seeing more of him). Characters who were hyped in interviews but turned out to be of little importance include Ginny Weasley, who winds up doing absolutely nothing of relevance throughout the whole book, whereas she was annoyingly and tediously present (and acting like a complete jerk) in Half-Blood Prince. Despite my dislike of this character, I had expected to see much more of her, and I was disappointed to see her true purpose was bearing Harry Potter's childrens in one of the, if not the, least believable ""romances"" of the series.The book, and the series, then end with a cloying epilogue which tells us little about things that actually matter and instead focuses on who marries who, complete with precocious children (who are naturally of similar ages; so considerate of everyone to get pregnant at the same time!) and insipid names (Albus Severus, but no child named after Ginny's dead brother?). I like to pretend this epilogue, or ""crapilogue"" as disappointed fans have dubbed it, doesn't exist, and that the series officially ends after Harry kills Voldemort. Leaves much more to the imagination and is much more of a fitting end.My expectations prior to the release were faily high. That turned out to be a mistake. I won't be rereading this installment any time soon, possibly not ever again.

Starting off with a discussion between Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and the death of Charity Burbage,the first chapter succeeded in sending a cold shiver down my spine. While on the other side Harry and the Dursleys part ways and Harry gets ready to leave his old house,No matter how much I used to hate Dudley I forgave him in this and I wish they put the part where Aunt Petunia says........It would have shown that she was not heartless as she seems..It's also hard to believe that Harry Potter has grown up........Yup fellows he's grown upSoo the Aurors and his friends comes to pick up Harry aand....Six of them uses Harry's hair into a Polyjuice and disguises themselves as Harry in order to keep him safe, fearing Lord Voldemort will attack them.I nearly died laughingAnd the BEST NEWS is Lupin and Tonks are married!!!!! And Bill and Fleur are engaged!! SO FREAKING ADORABLE*sigh*Sniff. SniffTaking one last look at his childhood home Harry leaves with Hagrid (always loved the big guy).Whew. I have to admit I couldn't handle the emotional rollercoaster in the first few chapters which is so unlike of me. Fear, surprise, happiness, heartbreak. All of them hit too much too fast. But all the same I enjoyed it.
The Characters
Never grows old. Love the old loons as ever and yeah, on the verge of killing the bad guys (tho I admit I might have teeny tiny crush on Voldemort). It was tho as I actually lived with them. They made me laugh, cry, happy and most of all they taught me love. Harry Potter characters will always have a magical place in my heart. (especially Hagrid, Lupin, Tonks and Snape.)I always loved Hagrid. He was the best father figure Harry ever had. He led a sad life, being expelled for something he never did, rejected from the society and living in solitary. But there's something that made him special. No matter what the world said Hagrid was always good in heart. In fact, he has the biggest heart among the characters. I loved the fact he never gave up on himself and remained loyal to himself and his friends. His weird obsession over monsters and his horrible rock cakes only made me love him more. He was not afraid to be himself. In the end when I thought Hagrid will die, I shut the book and cried my heart out praying 'Not Hagrid please. Anyone but him'. Hagrid means so much to me and he will always have the biggest place in my heart. Forever.Snape. I know lot of people didn't forgive him but I do. It's weird but I felt sad for him. Humans make mistakes even wizards. I'm glad he tried to do his best, even though his hatred towards James still remained. I'm not trying to sugarcoat him, it's just I don't have the heart to hate him. Everyone in this world has someone who they don't like. The whole Mudblood thing was pretty shocking but still I forgive him. I admire his loyalty and his sacrifice. He showed me that heroes can hide in the most unlikely places and can be the most unlikely people. And sometimes to do the right thing you'll have to sacrifice a lot of things. Sometimes even life. Love him. Always.Remus and Tonks..*sigh*. I loved them so much. They are the best couple in the whole series.Two unlikely people in love. Love Lupin for his strength and love Tonks for her spirit. Being a Metamorphmagus, means Tonks can change into the most beautiful woman in the world. But instead she chose to be her clumsy self with vibrant pink hair. The amount of self love in her is truly amazing. Yeah, Lupin might be a little coward when it comes to his marriage but hey! if I was in his position I would feel the same. Love them both!!

The Plot
Loved it!!!! Especially the story of the DH.....My heart warmed at the sweet friendship between Harry Hermione....Love the trust between them. This is the kind of friendship I dream ofAnd yeah, died laughing at this.............Ron is so cute when he goes all possessive and jealous over HermioneAdmired Ron for his love and care towards HermioneHow fast feelings change lolMy heart broke seeing Snape's past......Magical, unexpected, beautiful, heartbreaking and loved it!!
The Ending
THE ENDING!!!! THE FREAKING ENDING!!! The urge to rip out the pages was so overwhelming. I cried a river...It was really sad and yet somehow beautiful I don't know whether I should be glad that the Dark Ages are over or be miserable since all my fav characters died.I THINK THE AUTHORS GET THOSE MANLY URGES WHEN THEY WRITEHas this happened to anyone else?But anyway I loved it. The ending was indeed heartbreaking, but the last few pages made up for it,Harry Potter. Always.

About the Book
5 HEARTBREAKING MOONY STARS!!!!I loved this book so much. The twists, the plot they were so magical and well planned. I'm one of those readers who........I've been a huge Potter fan for almost 9 years. And this is one of the books I can't stop reading again and again. True love, self-love, friendship, sacrifice, loyalty were some of the great lessons I learnt from this book. I was so sad when the story ended. I missed the Golden Trio so much. I just wish I could forget all of this so I can reread it all over again. ENJOY!!!!

Regulus' backstory (I wish we had more), the ""road trip"" part of the book, Dumbledore's backstory (I still wish we had an entire book about him and Grindelwald, from their first meeting until their Duel in 1945), Snape's backstory, another part we all figured out before the book came out but was also still amazing, Ron and Hermione endgame, Narcissa lying to Voldemort to save her son, Neville standing up, everything.It was an amazing conclusion to the most amazing book series, until that damn epilogue. Yes, I know that I still gave it five stars, just like for each Harry Potter book. It's because I decided to ignore it. I read it twice in the book (only because the first time I read the books, it was the french translation) and watched it once in the movie. Then, every time I read it, I stop at what I decided was the end for me and I do the same thing when I watch the movie. I know many people love it, because isn't it wonderful to know that, in the end, ""all was well""? And I respect that people feel that way. But it just didn't do it for me the first time and it still doesn't. I know why J.K. Rowling did it, I understand. It even makes more sense given that children also read it and because people in general want a happy ending like the one she delivered. But here's the thing:What is truly amazing in this world and in those books is that, despite the magical universe, it feels real and we can relate to it so much from the beginning until the end. I first read The Deathly Hallows when it was released in French, I think it was in October or November 2007, I'm not sure. I was 15. First, I think that I'm far from being the only Millenial not being able to relate to ""all was well"". There are others reasons that I'd rather not dwell on. But the true end in this book for me, the one we can all relate to, was just after the War ended. It was hopeful, but with a vibe of ""and from now on, they'll have to heal and rebuild"" and we didn't know how they were gonna do it, where they were gonna start, each one of them, whether some wouldn't be able to. And that was okay for me, because it was an ending where, yes the Dark side had been defeated in the War, yes there was hope, while still being realistic and relatable. For me, this is the true end. Just like in the movie, the true end, the one filled with hope but relatable is that last scene where we see Harry, Hermione and Ron standing outside of Hogwarts, in the middle of the ruins, looking at the future in front of them.

Snape since childhood loved Lily Evans (Harry’s mother) and after Voldemort killed her, he joined Dumbledore. He was working as a double agent on Dumbledore’s orders and since then was protecting and helping Harry. Harry along with his friends destroyed all the Horcruxes and killed Voldemort. They won the battle but lost many of their closed ones - Fred, Lupin and Tonks, among others.

I've been up and down with this series and I found this particular book a slog, mid way I totally slumped and I wondered if I'd be spending the rest of my life stuck in a tent with Harry and Hermione regretting not doing a bunk with Ron. Finally, i've reached the finishing line. I really enjoyed the first few books, personally I don't feel Rowling has enough content to justify books the size of bricks. The last few books the whole plot line has happened in the last 20% of the book and the rest of the time your just plodding along with Dumbledore in your ear talking in riddles, making zero sense and waiting for Harry to have an OMG moment when the riddles unravel themselves. I think I missed the boat in the magic of this series. I think the wait for the books to be written, being 11 years old and growing with Harry probably all contribute to the enjoyment of the reading experience but for a woman in her thirties who has chosen not to procreate, I just couldnt deal with the teenage mood swings and having to read about so much snogging without getting a sex scene. I'm also not sure this is YA, it felt more Middle Grade to me but I do appreciate that the YA genre as a whole has had a total overhaul since HP was written and categorised. I also think the hype for these books has died since the author has become problematic and that definitely contributed to my stump spells. It's hard to get behind characters that have been created by someone who doesn't fit into your own core values. And honestly, I hated the ending but I think now we have more insight into Rowling's world view i guess the traditional everyone will marry their high school sweetheart and have children ending isn't such a surprise. I'm glad I read this though, there's certainly some characters I've enjoying spending time with, the first three books especially were such fun and even the last few books I've enjoyed the beginning and the endings, its the middle parts of the books where nothing happens that have irritated me. Overall I give this series three stars, it was fine, I liked it for what it was.

 ""The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."" I think I've made it quite clear throughout my years on Goodreads how much the Harry Potter series and world means to me, but I have yet to do any kind of review on any of the books. This series means so much to so many people, it gave me friends when I had none, and most importantly, the courage to be myself. There are so many wonderful things about this series; how detailed the world is, the history, the myriad of different characters. But maybe my favourite part of the story is how realistic the characters are. They are without a doubt flawed, Harry often acting too quick (and without much thought) while trying to carry the world on his shoulders, Ron's feelings of intense jealousy that follow him through the whole series, and Hermione's sometimes narrow mindedness. These are the things that made me fall in love with these characters. I could see myself in them and they never made me feel less than—they made mistakes just like every other human being. This has marked I think close to the twelfth time I have reread this series, and every time it somehow manages to shape the person I turn into. Every time I read this series there is a new problem I am facing, a different quality in myself I am battling with, and I always feel like I take some kind of knowledge or comfort from this series, from all different characters. Each time, I relate to a character I had never paid much attention to, I fall in love with an aspect that I never gave much thought to before. I think that no matter where I am in the world or what I am doing, the wizarding world of Harry Potter will always be my home.  So until next time, I will miss you.

I'll repeat what everyone else says: she has inspired and motivated millions of kids to read and write, and that alone means she deserves all the awards. Hermione will always be my home girl, and I highly recommend this series to everyone of any age group.

I last read this book when I was 14 years old, given that I'm almost 32 now, I have a whole new perspective on it.

Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no … their last hope was gone.
I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.
‘I don’t know how I did it,’ he said slowly. ‘I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldn’t suck it out of me … but it kept me sane.
I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through. Previously, this was a magical Cinderella-like tale about a boy in a room under the stairs. With this book, the story became twisted, and it became something more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters

So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.

It's a rainy Sunday. It's colder than it should be this time of the year, so I'm drinking a delicious cup of coffee and I'm browsing my Goodreads shelves only to realise that I haven't written a Harry Potter review. Not a single one. So, I decided to start with the first Harry Potter book I ever read, the one that took me to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and made me believe that magic is something tangible.

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” 

I was 16 years old, and I had just started my english classes in order to pass my Proficiency examinations. My teacher told me that the best way to delve into a foreign language and familiarize with it is to read books written in it, so she gave me the third instalment of Harry Potter. (Little did she know that she unleashed a beast who now reads almost exclusively in english). Before I tell you about my experience, I need to make a confession. It was my choice to stay away from J.K. Rowling's books until that moment. I wanted to swim against the current, and I thought that Harry Potter was too ""mainstream"" for my taste. And the foolish little me was proud of this decision. But when my teacher gave me this old, used copy, something inside me cracked. I knew the basics about the story, about the orphan kid who goes to a school for wizards and fights the ugly, evil dude who doesn't have a nose. But page by page, I came to understand with awe that the wizard who finds trouble even when he doesn't want to offers more than that; he opened a portal to a world where I longed to be fervently. I stayed up late at night, with a faint light just enough to make out the sentences, and I cheered for Gryffindor's Quidditch team, I flied with Firebolt and I kept wondering what my patronus would be (according to Pottermore it's a brown mastiff, which is oddly fitting). I casted spells (but never Avada Kedavra, you shouldn't play with this shit) and tasted butterbeer in Hogsmeade, and just like that, my life had changed irrevocably. I was a Potterhead. And I was proud of that. (my mum wasn't though, especially when I asked for a wand).

“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

There is a reason why J.K. Rowling is the fairy god-mother to millions of children (and adults) worldwide. Friendship, love, hope, they're present in her books even in the most desperate times, when Evil seems undefeatable, when no escape is visible. She encourages and empowers, shows that everything is possible, that strength and courage can be found within, when you have someone to hold your hand. Harry was a kid who was deprived of love yet he was capable of loving, it took him years but he finally found a place to belong, to feel safe and cared. Ron, with his witty lines and his constant presence, Hermione, my personal favorite, with her intelligence and compassion, they managed to enchant my prejudiced heart, and even now, years later, I'm still under their spell. I think I will always be.

“Don't let the muggles get you down.”

I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter, and secretly hope that Dobby is the one to blame. I still caress with affection the spines of my Harry Potter books (meanwhile I bought them all and finished the entire series in a week and a half) and laugh at Harry Potter jokes. And I know, and it's imprinted in my soul, that I'll never be a muggle again.

Unfortunately we weren’t blessed with all too many Lupin scenes. >_<3.) ”How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. A small amount of talent on the Quidditch pitch made him think he was a cut above the rest of us, too. Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers… the resemblance between you is uncanny.”And speaking of the best teacher we come directly to the worst! Snape is such a horrible teacher I can’t even! I said it once and I’ll say it again: He's cruel, he's a bully, he takes delight in instilling fear in his students. And he verbally and emotionally abuses them. His personal vendetta against Harry who never ever did anything to him except of looking like his dead father is just crazy! Movie Snape is way nicer than the one in the books and I'm sorry but if you ask me #SnapeCan'tBeRedeemed""!!4.) ”They’ve got a new captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory-“Angelina, Alicia and Katie suddenly giggled.“What?” said Wood, frowning at this light-hearted behaviour.“He’s that tall, good-looking one, isn’t he?” said Angelina.It’s the third book and Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang are already mentioned! Also did anyone notice that they are both introduced as Seekers as well? ;-) So we have all the main players for book 4! Harry, Draco, Cho and Cedric! XD (On a side note: Considering the giggling girls Robert Pattinson truly is a good cast! *lol*) 5.) ”You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told?”Ron never ceases to amaze me! He’s such a shy guy but boy does he become a lion when he defends the people he cares about! <3 6.) ”Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope and happiness out of the air around them. Even Muggles feel their presence, though they can’t see them. Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory, will be sucked out of you.”The Dementor’s Kiss reminded me of one of my rp characters that died through one. Ahh the good old roleplay times. *lol* Anyway, moving on! I was always intrigued by the idea of Dementors and even after so many years their existence and mystery still didn’t lose its appeal! They are really fascinating creatures and even though I never want to meet one I still can’t help but take an interest in them. =) Certainly one of the best things about this book! 7.) ”Mr Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people’s business.”The first mention of the Marauder’s Map! “The Prisoner of Azkaban” is certainly one of those main books that build the foundation for everything that’s yet to come. And it’s already way darker than its predecessors. Bless Fred and George for handing Harry the map! Heaven knows he’ll have good use for it in the years to come. ;-P8.) ”They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead, and listening to echoes of them won’t bring them back.”It always kills me to read about how Harry struggles with the knowledge - or rather the lack of knowledge - about his parents. My heart bleeds for him whenever they are mentioned. I mean jeez, he’d endure a Dementor just to hear their voices. T_T9.) “She’s got her heart in the right place, Hermione has, an’ you two not talkin’ to her –“ Is it just me or is this actually a reoccurring theme? Since book one there always seem to be sections in which they don’t talk to each other because something gets in their way. And if my memory serves me right things are going to continue in this vein. XD 10.) ”She had slapped Malfoy around the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered.”Once again I want to point out that I’m a pacifist! The way Hermione dished out that slap was pretty spectacular though! *lol* Guess she took Mr. Weasley as an example. Haha! Sound advice for parents: You better don’t slap mean people in front of your kids! ;-P Also is it just me or did anyone else notice the irony of the situation? A person like Hermione, a person that values words, resorted to actions because she realized words won’t get her far with a Malfoy. *lol* 11.) ”THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING-““Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way-!”“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!”Jordan’s Quidditch commentary is legit one of the best things about the series! Well and the matches themselves of course. XD Plus McGonagall swearing like a trooper because the Slytherin team was playing so foul is one of the best things ever! Haha! Especially because she obviously tried to keep everything objective and neutral at first. *lol*11.) (view spoiler)[”I’m not doing this for you, I’m doing it because I don’t reckon my dad would’ve wanted his best friends to become killers – just for you.”Harry is a far better person than many others would have been! Even after everything Wormtail did he still didn’t allow Sirius and Lupin to kill him. He would have had every reason to let them finish him off yet he thought of the consequences for his father’s best friends first. Aside from that I still believe that Harry would have never allowed them to kill him because he knows it’s not right. If he proved anything to us by now, then it’s that he’s a very righteous and compassionate person. (hide spoiler)]12.) (view spoiler)[”I don’t want a bond with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He betrayed my parents!”“This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me… the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”Once again the foreshadowing!!! Rowling is a master at this discipline! XD (hide spoiler)]I can’t wait to read “The Goblet of Fire”! Not just because it’s one of my favourite HP books but also because I want to find out which other details I missed the first time around! It will get dark now and I’m so ready for it!!! <3_________________I’m on a Harry Potter roll this year!So now that Christmas is coming closer with every passing day it’s about time to dive into one of my favourites! =)I always liked “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! Not only because the kids have grown so much but also because it marks the beginning of the series getting all “Sirius”. *lol* (Sorry, I couldn’t help it. XD)But honestly, there are so many awesome things that happen in this book and there are so many new characters that are introduced, it’s just amazing! <3Happy reading! I’m sure I’ll have a good time!

The occurring of events seemed much less transparent, and manages to keep the reader well in suspense right till the end. The plot feels to be moving more in-line with the core of series - towards a bit darker side - as the first two had already laid a strong foundation. And the world of magic keeps expanding, with a lot of interesting elements being added to it! I hope I'm not getting ahead of myself when I say, this is becoming one of my favorite book series of all time.""I know how to use a fellytone now""

ENGLISH (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) / ITALIANO«Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard»Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban prison is on every wizard's lips. Not even the dreaded guards of the prison, the Dementors, managed to keep in a cage the wicked wizard, who probably want to meet again his master, Voldemort. But to do that, firstly he must kill Harry Potter, the only one capable to stand up to Voldemort... Meanwhile, the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Harry, Ron and hermione will become acquainted with two new professors...Compared to the previous, the third volume of the series is the one that is richer in twists and turns. I'm reading the saga of Harry Potter to my daughter, when in the evening she goes to bed, and in this ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" a little tragedy happened. When we got to ""The kiss of the dementor"" chapter, just hearing the title my daughter (6 years old) was so upset by what it might happen that she required that I read that chapter alone, and just then telling her what was going on by omitting the scary details. Apart from this hiccup, the reading was neat and clean. It is evident that the playful and carefree tones of the first two adventures give way to dark colors. After all harry is growing up, and its way of seeing things is supposed to change as well. Rowling takes us in the maturation process of the most famous little wizard of the world using the same plot device of the previous volumes: the teachings of Headmaster Dumbledore, the clashes with Malfoy, the bickering with Hermione, the conflicts with Professor Snape. I do not know if in the near future I will continue to read to my daughter the Harry Potter saga, or if I will wait she grows enough to read it alone to avoid upsetting her again. Never mind. I will go on because now it is not possible for me to stop reading, with the pleasant awareness that there is no healthier addiction of this one. ""Get high"" yourself too.Vote: 10




«Harry Potter era un ragazzo insolito sotto molti punti di vista. Prima di tutto, odiava le vacanze estive più di qualunque altro periodo dell'anno. Poi voleva davvero fare i compiti, ma era costretto a studiare di nascosto, nel cuore della notte. E per giunta era un mago»La fuga di Sirius Black dalla prigione di Azkaban è sulla bocca di tutti i maghi. Nemmeno i temuti guardiani del carcere, i Dissennatori, sono riusciti a tenere in gabbia il malvagio stregone, che si dice voglia riunirsi al suo padrone, Voldemort. Per farlo però dovrà prima eliminare Harry Potter, l'unico che fino ad ora è stato in grado di tenere testa a Voldemort... Nel frattempo, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per cominciare il nuovo anno scolastico, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione faranno la conoscenza di due nuovi professori...Rispetto ai due precedenti, il terzo volume della serie è quello più ricco di colpi di scena, e di conseguenza quello con il ritmo più serrato. Sto leggendo la saga di Harry Potter a mia figlia quando la sera va a letto, ed in questo ""Harry Potter e il Prigioniero di Azkaban"" è successa una piccola tragedia. Arrivati al capitolo ""il bacio del dissennatore"", al solo sentire il titolo mia figlia (6 anni) è rimasta così turbata da quello che sarebbe potuto accadere che ha preteso che lo leggessi io da solo, e che le raccontassi quello che succedeva omettendo i particolari spaventosi. A parte questo intoppo, la lettura è continuata liscia. E' evidente che i toni giocosi e spensierati delle prime due avventure lasciano il posto a sfumature a tratti cupe e goticheggianti. D'altronde Harry sta crescendo, e si suppone che cambi anche il suo modo di vedere le cose. La Rowling ci accompagna nel processo di maturazione del maghetto più famoso del mondo utilizzando gli stessi espedienti narrativi usati negli altri volumi: gli insegnamenti di Silente, gli scontri con Malfoy, i battibecchi con Hermione, i conflitti con Piton. Non so se nell'immediato futuro continuerò a leggere a mia figlia la saga di Harry Potter, o se aspetterò che cresca abbastanza da essere in grado di leggerseli da sola per evitare adesso di turbarla. Non importa. Io andrò avanti perchè per me non è più possibile fermarmi, con la piacevole consapevolezza che non esiste dipendenza più salutare di questa. ""Drogatevi"" anche voi.Voto: 10

But I also love that Hedwig finds Harry.📚Chapter 4: The Leaky Cauldron After jumping on Ron’s head, Crookshanks gets a new home with Hermione.📚Chapter 5: The DementorsHagrid being named a teacher and getting teary-eyed when the trio congratulates him, warms my heart!🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***I greatly enjoy the dive into the Knight Bus. How it appears for wizards in trouble. It’s also a very interesting point, Harry is quick to help his friends, but doesn’t offer any money. Interesting.📚Chapter 6: Talons and Tea LeavesMy favorites are tied in this chapter- between Hermione calling out Trelawney about “predictions” and Malfoy getting his ass handed to him by Buckbeak.📚Chapter 7: The Boggart in The Wardrobe Obviously my favorite part is Snape dressed as Neville’s gran.📚Chapter 8: Flight of the Fat LadySo much happening in this chapter- but my fav is simply Neville’s gran sending his Hogsmeade permission slip directly to the school, cause sure enough he misplaced his copy.📚Chapter 9: Grim DefeatAlas, the whomping willow got its revenge… on Harry’s broom.📚Chapter 10: The Marauders MapI love that the Weasley twins entrust Harry with the map.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***The points made regarding Snape, his history with Lupin (and his gang), makes for a better understanding of behavior. 📚Chapter 11: The FireboltRon offering to make tea, for an upset Hagrid, because that’s what his mom does.📚Chapter 12: The PatronusNeville, being Neville, wrote down the passwords and lost them.📚Chapter 13: Gryffindor versus RavenclawRon trying to convince everyone that he saw Sirius Black in his room.📚Chapter 14: Snape’s GrudgeHarry scaring the shit out of Malfoy, was the best!📚Chapter 15: The Quidditch FinalOf course the best part is Gryffindors win.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-15***Warning: podcast has adult content***Ron joking with Harry about loaning him money- he didn’t even offer to replace your spello tape wand… not happening my dude.📚Chapter 16: Professor Trelawney’s Prediction Hermione being freaked out by her Boggart final.📚Chapter 17: Cat Rat and DogSirius making himself known.📚Chapter 18: Moony Wormtail Padfoot and ProngsLupin explaining that the womping willow was planted at Hogwarts because of him.📚Chapter 19: The Servant of the Lord Voldemort Ron justifying a rat living for 12 years, by saying his family has taken such great care of him.📚Chapter 20: The Dementors KissHarry’s happy thoughts about leaving the Dursley’s to live with Sirius.📚Chapter 21: Hermione’s SecretOf course Hermione has a time turner.📚Chapter 22: Owl Post AgainHarry having a godfather in Sirius is so heartwarming.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 16-22***Warning: podcast has adult content***This one made me a bit tearful.🎬Movie #3This one is rough, cause so much of the story is missing- but I will simply say, I love how Hermione calls Ron “Ronald” throughout. That’s some great foreshadowing.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***All good points made- Trelawney casting is so spot on!And that concludes my re-read of Prisoner of Azkaban.

Time. The things we could accomplish if we had extra time on our hands. Just this week I mentioned to people that I have been running on fumes with all the things I had to get done. If only I had a few extra hours in my week to take a nap or rest with a book. Thankfully, we have a leap year, providing our busy lives with a full extra day to get those things done that may have been pushed to the back burner. Whether it’s catching up on sleep, reading, or chores, a leap year creates the impression that there is indeed an extra day to accomplish those things that may have been pushed to the wayside. Despite this, adults rarely have the time to go back and savor favorite books, but, in 2020 a group of us in Retro Chapter Chicks have decided to take the time to reread Harry Potter in all its glory. I find it appropriate that on a day where we can enjoy extra time, that I curled up with my favorite book in the series, one that indeed tests the limit of place and time. A mass murderer has escaped from prison. The news is so important that it even made the Muggle news. Even Muggles who detest magic like the Dursleys are on high alert. For Harry Potter, a wizard about to enter his third year at Hogwarts, it is just another summer vacation. Although famous and living up to his name during his first two years at school, at the Dursleys he is treated like less than human. His living conditions have advanced from a cupboard under the stairs to a room with bars on the window and a flap on the door for which to receive stone cold meals. Even though Aunt Petunia is Harry’s blood relative, she also treats him like vermin. Things couldn’t get any worse until Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge arrives for a weeklong visit, and she believes that Harry is worthless and ungrateful to his family. What Marge fails to realize is that this so called family wishes that Harry did not exist. Harry’s true family is thicker than blood and bound by magic: his Hogwarts family. Each summer, life at Dursleys grows unbearable and Marge’s treatment of Harry puts things over the top. In a fit of teenage emotions, Harry causes Marge to blow up, and then he leaves the Dursleys home, for what he thinks is hopefully for good this time. Normally use of magic outside of school is grounds for expulsion from school, but, with a murderer named Sirius Black on the loose, the Minister of Magic himself has bent the rules in Harry’s favor. Minister Cornelius Fudge believes that Black is a dark wizard and servant of Lord Voldemort, and, in his eyes, the safest place for Harry is at Hogwarts under the watchful eyes of Albus Dumbledore. Harry gets a reprieve and is allowed to spend three weeks of his summer vacation away from the Dursleys and will indeed get to return to Hogwarts to continue his magical education. With the addition of Black to the storyline, the stories only get darker. Readers find out that he is the first ever prisoner to escape from Azkaban prison located in the middle of the sea and guarded by dementors, creatures so foul that they suck the happy memories from all those around them. Fudge is convinced that Black is after Harry and has stationed dementors outside of Hogwarts, much to Dumbledore’s chagrin. As long as Dumbledore is headmaster, dementors will not be allowed inside the castle because he foresees that these horrid creatures are allied with Voldemort. Black was able to outsmart them, and all of England is on high alert. It is against this backdrop and protection that Harry returns to Hogwarts. Third year students have more responsibilities and more freedoms. They are allowed to visit the village of Hogsmeade provided a parent or guardian signed a form; the Dursleys did not. Yet, they also have enough magical training to sign up for extra classes. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine enroll in Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, taught by none other than Hagrid. Hermoine also begins the study of Ancient Runes, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies. Harry and Ron do not understand how anyone, even one as smart as Hermoine, could take that many classes. Some are at the same time as others, which makes it humanly impossible for her to attend two classes at once. The dialogue between Ron and Hermoine involving her class schedule speaks to growing relationship between the two, a relationship which neither is mature enough to recognize. Meanwhile, class work has gotten harder. Professor Snape loathes Harry more than ever, and the new Defense of the Dark Arts professor Lupin is an old friend of Harry’s father. Hagrid, while the nicest person around and Harry’s protector, is threatened by the Malfoys yet again, this time after Draco is scratched by a hippogriff named Buckbeak because he refused to pay attention in class. Buckbeak is threatened with execution, adding to the animosity between Harry and Draco, and only Hermoine, on top of her grueling class schedule, finds the time to assist Hagrid in his defense. All these storylines would make for an exciting tale, but inserting Lupin and Black and Harry’s anti-dementor training make this book the turning point in the entire series. The story progresses, and animals play a key role in plot development: Ron’s rat, Hermoine’s cat, and a large black dog. The three are infinitely linked to one another. Rowling reveals that Black was the Potters’ secret keeper and only him revealing their whereabouts would expose their location to Voldemort. He was supposedly in jail for murdering twelve innocent people plus a tag along named Peter Pettigrew. He is also Harry’s godfather. This information has Harry’s growing teenaged emotions on high. He is more determined than ever to defeat Voldemort and his legion of dark creatures and takes necessary precautions to guard himself against the darkness. Although teenaged pranks occur in this book, my favorite scenes are between Harry and Lupin and Black. Being able to interact with one of his parents’ closest friends, one really feels for Harry as an orphan and sees that he truly belongs in the wizarding world and not at the Dursleys. As Rowling will reveal much, much later, Dumbledore has his reasons for placing Harry there, but with each book it gets harder and harder for him to return, even if the presence of these Muggles is key to the plot line. Time, of course, plays a key role in the plot as well. Hermoine reveals that she has been using a time turner to get to her classes all year but promised not to tell anyone. Sirius turns out to be none other than the dog who has made an appearance throughout the book. He is innocent, yet the only people who believe him are Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and Professor Dumbledore. Lupin is indeed his closest friend and also a werewolf, and it is Pettigrew who is the servant of Lord Voldemort. This, Dumbledore explains to Harry, is magic at its deepest, most impenetrable moments and, in my opinion, the essence of the entire series. As Dumbledore points out time and again, it is one’s choices that determine one’s fate, not their abilities. For a few glorious moments Harry believes that he can live with Sirius and escape the Dursleys once and for all; it is the most touching moment, and the scene in the movie where the two of them are staring at Hogwarts castle has brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion. Yet, this moment is indeed fleeting. The Ministry of Magic still believes that Sirius is a dark wizard and he is forced to flee on Buckbeak the innocent Hippogriff. Readers know that this moment is indeed fleeting because Harry and Sirius will eventually be reunited but for only a short amount of time. It makes for a necessary storyline later on but one that gets harder and harder to stomach with each passing reading. Pretending that I do not know what comes next; however, knowing that Sirius and Lupin reappear in future books is what has always had me excited at the end of this book, a crossroads between the end of Harry’s adolescence and the darker times that lurk on the horizon. Time. J.K. Rowling has shown us what can happen if well meaning witches and wizards are given just a few hours extra in their days. Most adults with busy lives wish they were afforded the opportunity to relive hours and minutes in order to accomplish even the most mundane tasks. The climax of this book has revealed how precious time is and to take advantage of what time we do have in order to live life to the fullest. This year’s leap day provided me with the opportunity to reread favorite books and get some much needed rest that I needed after a busy week. Even in this busy life that I lead, I have found the time to visit Harry Potter’s magical world yet again. As the plot moves deeper into Harry’s teenaged years, and, he and his friends are about to embark on fighting the forces of evil, it is obvious that they have left their childhood behind. It is the moments that mark the end of this book combined with the extra time afforded to us this year that show us just how precious the time we have is to us all. 5+ stars All time favorite book

This home prison a.k.a voluntarily quarantine making cookies and throwing them into trash days( I never say I’m a good cook and each day I’m getting worse!) giving me nostalgic vibes. It’s like living never ending mercury retrograde! You don’t want to start a new thing, you have to go back to your past or you have to deal with your unfinished businesses.  Of course this is not a book from my TBR or DNF list. I’ve read it very same day it has been released: 16 freaking years ago when I was still hot, dump, in my silly 20’s . The year I finished it, I flipped my bird to my managers at the workplace and quitted for chasing my writing dreams. (It was not entertaining, sunshine and rainbow story, there is so much rebellion, pain, fight, humiliation but freedom never comes without dues to pay!) And after devouring this book in one day( because I locked myself at my childhood room. Yes, I was single! It was easier to isolate yourself!) and I decided that’s my all time favorite Harry Potter book (I know there were more to come but my life was changing and my three musketeers’ lives were also going different directions. They were finally growing up, just like me!)  Sirius Black has a special place in my heart and at the beginning he escaped from Azkaban and we think he was after Harry to kill him. This book faces Harry’s past trauma about his family, his guilt feelings, night terror, his self insecurities and sometimes we think his inner demons were more terrifying than the outside world’s vicious, dangerous avengers coming after him. And at the end, Harry and Sirius’s special relationship always melts my heart and fills my eyes in tears. I always find this is one of the most meaningful and genuine relationships JKR formed between two characters.  And we also see the growing pains of two main characters: Ron always loyal, likable, witty and Hermione is passionate, intelligent but also kind-hearted. Maybe this is the best part of their story because after this book, everything gets bleaker, darker and more violent! My dear three musketeers’ lives will never be the same. I read this book 16 years by locking myself in my room and as a de je vu or reenactment of my younger and dumber self, I reread my favorite HP book. I smiled, entertained, cried, jumped, horrified again! And I felt good and gave my five gazillion stars over and over again! In these days, the best thing you gotta do: sticking with the things that makes you happy and rekindle your past experiments by making a visit to your memory lane with a great book!That’s what I did and it worked so well with me!

Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. ""I don't know why I even bother,"" he muttered to himself. ""I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?""He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. ""A-HA!"" he yowled. ""Gotcha!"" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. ""Where you gonna run to now, ratty?"" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. ""Please,"" it said. ""Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!""""A mistake, eh?"" the cat said. ""We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....""He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. ""Think, Peter, think,"" he said. ""Gotta get out of here, but..."" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. ""You may just have given me my way out, cat,"" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. ""They'll think it was you,"" he said. ""They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord."" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. ""It's not safe here anymore."" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. ""If I were human,"" he said, ""the fall would kill me. But as a rat...."" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better...

I think this is a large part of Rowling’s success. She could have fell into a trap and continuously wrote books like the first two, but instead she moved her story forward and let it grow. And her readers rejoice. This is also the first time the real threat to Harry is realised. Sure, we’ve seen Voldemort on the back of Professor Quirrel’s head and we saw an early Tom Riddle in the form of Horcorux diary type thing, but the dementors were an entirely different level of danger. The entire story felt less comic and less feel-good, for the first time it seemed like Harry Potter could actually die if he didn’t find his courage and repel them with his power. He owed much to Lupin here, a character who becomes slightly overlooked as the series progresses, but a hugely pivotal one in the development of Harry. And, for me, that’s why this one is the best because eit is the one where Harry truly found his confidence.

I love the first two books in this series, but I love them for their magical quality, their appeal to children, and their overall introduction to this world.But The Prisoner of Azkaban, at least for me, marks the shift into adolescence and the less tidy endings.And, of course, the introduction of Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to the plot.I loved rereading this third book the past two weeks with my middle child, and I can not get over this new set of the illustrated series by Jim Kay. I mean. . . I'm not sure I can imagine a reading experience more sublime. Can you?My two absolute highlights from this novel are:When Remus Lupin turns to Hermione Granger and says, “You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.” It's a shift from everyone poking fun of Hermione for being a teacher's pet or a “nerd” and acknowledging her as a force to be reckoned with.And Jim Kay's illustration of Harry summoning his first real Patronus. . . my God, I turned the page, and goosebumps ran down the entire length of my body. Then I cried like a child. My daughter, who was sitting next to me, wasn't exactly surprised (she's been around for the last two years of this horror called perimenopause), but she was like, “Mom, pull it together.”I couldn't help it. Damn it, I think I'd run back into a burning building to grab this book.Remus!

I hate him so much and when Sirius voice broke after he told Harry what truly happened that he was not their Secret Keeper, but it was Peter and then he found out that Lily and James died, I felt like my heart was cracking and I wanted to hug him and said to him that it was not his fault. Oh God, I just feel really sorry for Sirius. 
Remus Lupin is such a sweet character
He is honestly the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher! and he was also a caring and a sweet guy. He often smiled. He's smart, fun, and kind! he defended Neville when Snape bullied him or whatever that was because he kind of underestimated Neville and that was pretty mean, you know. I mean, yeah Neville might be reckless or that he often made mistakes, but seriously that was mean! he did not deserve it and I was so glad when Lupin defended him. This man was very amazing. so ... umm where do I find a guy like him in real life? he's such a sweet guy! OH! and one more thing, when Lupin was ill and he did not come to the class, but Snape came in the class instead ( I guess he was substituting this subject for a while because Lupin was ill) and he gave the students an assignment about werewolf so someone would realize his symptoms. UGH. SO WHAT IF HE'S A WEREWOLF? I mean, it would be okay if we put certain precautions. Basically, Lupin was just an amazing guy and I really like him. I am so sad that he resigned from teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts. He's the best teacher for this subject!  
Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney
One of the best scenes in this book for me is when Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney bickered. It was too funny ahahahahaha. Thank God, I was at home when I read this scene. I would surely get funny looks, if I laughed in public place. 


'If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal-gaze for him-''Imagine that,' said Professor McGonagall drily. 


HAHAHAHA I bursted out laughing when I read that part. That was just so funny.  
Hermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney
Look, I really adore Hermione. She's smart, brave and such a devoted friend. She's honestly one of my inspirational characters that I adore very much. However, I did not like it when she was being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney. It is okay, if she did not like the study or believe the study or whatever it was. It is totally okay. I also have some subjects that I do not like to study, but I never disrespect any teachers. So It just slightly annoyed me when Hermione being disrespectful toward Professor Trelawney 


Hermione snorted.'Well, honestly ... ""the fates have informed her"" ... who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!' she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. 


Indeed, I can see her point. I understand her. But still, it is not okay to say something like that. She did not even keep her voice low! That's just not okay at all in my opinion. Overall, I loved this book very much. I had a great adventure with it and my days felt so magical when I spent them by reading it. Thank you very much for reading and liking this review. I really appreciate it. I hope you all have a great day! bye!•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

"" Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. Just stick out your wand, step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go. ""
Harry Potter is a 13 year old boy now. He stays at his uncle's and aunt's house like he usually does for the whole summer. But this year is different, he can not control his anger anymore and he leaves his uncle's and aunt's house. There is also a man named Sirius Black, Mass-Murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort escaped from Azkaban. Most prisoners go mad withins weeks in Azkaban but this man doesn't and people say that he is coming after Harry and in Harry's first divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves and now, the school grounds are being Patrolled by DEMENTORS.My Opinion The cover of this book is so BEAUTIFUL! and the story was as amazing as the cover.I also found a new favorite character in this book and this person is Professor Lupin!! He is so cool and he is the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher I have ever met. because you know, all the Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers from the first book were not nice guys at all including that guy with useless ability. What's his name again?? LOCHART! GILDEROY LOCHART. I just remembered his name. Actually, where is he now? no one mentioned him and I hope I won't see him as a teacher in Hogwarts again. I still can't forgive him for what he was about to do with Ron and Harry in the second book. That guy is pathetic.I loved all the characters in this book and Fred and George weasley were so funny in this book. Percy is the last person I like. I don't hate him but I don't really like him too. He's so stritch about rules and sometimes he annoys me but not much. here is my favorite scene : 'How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?' asked Fred, as they tucked into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.'The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,' said Mr Weasley.  everyone looked up at him.'Why?' said Percy curiously.'it's because of you, Perce,' said George seriously. 'And there'll be little flags on the bonnets, with HB on them -''- for humungous Bighead,' said Fred. Everyone except Percy and Mrs Weasley snorted into their pudding. I laughed so hard in the middle of the night because of this. I wish I were there to see Percy's face when Fred and George said that. Oh! and I remembered I laughed so hard too when Ginny said he found out that Percy was kissing Penelope Clearwater, his girlfriend. I mean Percy is so stritch about rules and he always study, study, study, so the thought of Percy's having a girlfriend was never crossed my mind. But he was cool enough to get a girlfriend. *shrugs*I was so shocked when I found out that Sirius was innocent and the bad guy was Peter Pettigrew. how could he betray his own bestfriend?! I think he did it to save his own skin without thinking twice about his bestfriend's life. James and Lily Potter died because of him and how dare he to say that Sirius was the one who betrayed James Potter! this guy is more pathetic than Gilderoy and I was shocked when Harry told Lupin and Sirius not to kill him and put him in Azkaban instead. That moment I realised that Harry was so kind. this guy was the reason his parents died and he didn't want him to be killed. This book also have the best ending. the ending in this book made me grinning but don't get me wrong, the ending in the first and the second book were all great too but this ending was perfect. 'What's that?' he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. 'if it's another form for me to sign, you've got another -' 'it's not,' said Harry cheerfully. ' it's a letter from my godfather.' 'Godfather?' spluttered Uncle Vernon. 'you haven't got a godfather!.''Yes I hav,' said Harry brightly. 'He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check I'm happy...'And grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off towards the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last. Thank you guys for reading and liking my review. Hope you all have a great day!! ❤❤❤

It was like I was seeing all of this for the first time!I've really developed a deeper love, respect, and understanding for this series and the Wizarding world. I especially loved the fact that we actually got to learn about Remus Lupin and his backstory as a werewolf. I never would've learned any of this if I never decided to pick up these books.This series just gets better and better, and darker and darker. I can slowly see how Harry Potter is moving away from middle grade and into young adult. I'm really looking forward to how that shift becomes more prominent in the later books. Now next up is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite movie of the series growing up! Let's see how this one will go!

This series isn't up it's own ass; it's so accessible and readable and meaningful.God damn me! How could I have been so blind?Forgive me, because this book changed the game.

This - is my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.... It’s a great book - but not without its…problems….D’you get it? It’s because every goddamn sentence of this book contains either a dash or an ellipsis. (That’s one of the...problems….)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I’m debating whether to unleash the anti-Snape rant that’s been building up inside me for a decade now. I think I’ll wait until his supposedly redeeming backstory is revealed. What book is that in? Anyway, just his extensive presence in this book made the whole thing less fun for me.I feel about Snape the way Michael Scott feels about Toby. But I digress. My main thing with this book is that Rowling can be kind of...bad at fitting the parameters of the universe she created. That’s understandable, since it’s immense and so impressive, but there’s also little common sense things that get under my skin. (This would be under “general stupidity” if I hated this book - which I absolutely don’t.) I wanted to be having a great time, but instead I was caught up in the little mistakes.Some examples: There’s just no way McGonagall would have given Hermione the Time Turner. No way. I get the significance of the thing to the plot, and it’s a really creative and entertaining concept, but my girl Minerva would NEVER have handed that over. This is the woman who will shut any student down, take Harry Potter’s broom, deduct points from her own team, throw shade at Trelawney...what I’m saying is she’s a one hundred percent badass. And she’s a badass who exudes said badassery with the well-being of all Hogwarts students in mind. But I’m supposed to believe she put herself out there, petitioned the government, and presumably put in effort to convince her fellow faculty just so Hermione could take a purely overwhelming number of classes? Nah. She would have recognized it as unnecessary (Hermione never even gives a reason beyond ""wanting to"" for her overloaded schedule) and a huge pressure (workload's making a thirteen year old cry all the time and lose the ability to sleep). In other words, Minerva would have shut that shit down in a hot Texas minute.But wait - I have more examples! Lupin tells us that when he was at Hogwarts, they went through an INSANE amount of work to get him off the grounds when he ~underwent his transformation~. Keep in mind this whole thing is for one. Effing. Student. They put in a magic, violent tree (the infamous Whomping Willow), dig a tunnel that is presumably at least a mile or two long, and mess with (build?) a shack-like shelter. This is way, way, way too much to ensure that a single student can attend the school. But even suspending your disbelief there - why would you put a werewolf inside a WEAK, SHUT UP BUILDING to protect people? One, don’t put a rabid monstrous creature in a house, because two, he can break out of it and now the inhabitants of Hogsmeade are at risk. Also, putting in the Whomping Willow? Are you kidding me? It’s a danger to the students! And so is building a passageway in/out. There are so, so, so many more problems than solutions here.And here’s the most wild, laughable one for me. At the end, Sirius Black reveals that it was him - HIM! - who bought Harry Potter the Firebolt, hundreds-of-Galleons price tag and all. This is INSANE. Since Ron had earlier mentioned that it would have been impossible for Black to buy a broomstick, J.K. is so kind as to reveal how he did it in his letter to Harry. He says he sent Crookshanks (a f*cking cat) to the Owl Post, had him order the broomstick under Harry’s name, and had it charged to his own bank account at Gringotts. HAHAHAHA, WHAT?! You’re telling me a goddamn cat walked into a post office, conveyed the information that Harry Potter was ordering the most expensive broom on the market, and charged it to the most wanted man in Britain’s account without consequence? Like everyone was just like, yeah, okay, we didn’t really want to find him anyway? We won’t bring this up to the Ministry or Potter or anything? Jeeessssuuuuussss. Also, how did my guy have that much money in his account anyway? How is his account even open?Also, I know this is well-discussed, but there is just so much conflicting information about how many people attend Hogwarts. It drives me insane. I’ll never be satisfied with one answer, because there are always a million other pieces of evidence that conflict.The sheer confusion of the story relayed in the Shrieking Shack was also so confusing. Like, I get why there had to be a dozen f*cking pages of Black/Lupin begging the story to be told and Hermione/Ron/Harry essentially covering their ears and singing “Walking on Sunshine,” but they couldn’t at least have told the story with some semblance of organization once they finally got there? I mean, Jesus.On the other hand, characters. Hermione is still killin’ it - Time Turner, baby! And slaying those exams! But she did have less time with the squad (fighting) and a lot of scenes where it was just like, “Oh. Yeah. Hermione. Uh, she’s...doing homework over there.” Plus Neville was not really included, like, at all. But Lupin was introduced, and he’s one of my favorites! But Snape was here as hell and I hate him so much. But no Colin Creevey or Lockhart or Dobby! But Trelawney and Malfoy and Pansy. But Sirius! But mainly he was villain-ing it up. Oh well. It’s a real 50/50 in this one.Still, it was definitely enjoyable. Like, I read it in pretty much one sitting, and I haven’t done that in a whileeee. I missed doing it. And this was so, so much better than the second book. So this is so hard to rate! I am having a really hard time here, you guys. And my absolute favorite aspect of these books - which was missing in the second volume - was one hundred percent present and accounted for. I’m talking a look into the world, baby! We get Hogsmeade, we get an entire fortnight of Diagon Alley, we get a bunch of discussion of the school and the classes. Even the bad parts, like Azkaban. Ugh! I could read a series’ worth of books just on the world, I swear.So, bottom line: In some ways I liked this as much as the first, but it definitely had more problems. I am looking forward to continuing my reread, and hopin’ I find just as much of the world and even more of the good characters. Goblet of Fire, I expect to see you soon!

I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge...Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic.The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target....This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in.I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays...I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky......and I adored Buckbeak!!As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good.

I need more Lupin and Serius PLEASE.What I liked?- The books fighting with each other in the cages, I mean how much more mythical do you need?- I’m sorry… but this book made me realise how much of a crazy cat lady I am… Crookshanks is by far my favourite animal! How smart?! And the bouncing around together, stealing certain things, screaming- I think things were so well put together and placed… it had me living!- Draco dressing up as a Dementor for the Quidditch, I can’t, it’s making me laugh just thinking about it again - In fact, Quidditch in general. It was so well done and built up, it had me on edge thinking what’s going to happen?! It was built up so well and the descriptions used made me feel like I was there watching it play out (not only that, but top commentary) -I’ve been moaning that the end section seems to happen so quickly… but this? FINALLY I got what I wanted!- Hagrid has my heart!What I didn’t like?- You know… I’m not really a fan of Snape, I just don’t understand why he acts like he does to Harry for something that James did?Overall… well, hmmm… bring on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Philosopher's Stone 4.5 StarsChamber of Secrets - 4 StarsPrisoner of Azkaban - 5 StarsGoblet of Fire - 4.5 StarsOrder of the Phoenix - 4.5 Stars

I often found myself chuckling and even laughing out loud. I just had so much fun while reading!During the end, where all the conclusions are laid out, Rowling was being very thorough. I don't think that any questions are left open. Everything was well thought through, so that every single little detail adds up and makes sense. That's definitely something I wish I would read more often in other books!

Imprisoned he was in terrible Azkaban and guarded by frightening soul-sucking motherf**ckers.But courageously, Harry continued his journey, clashing with blond-bleached enemies, standing against the tyranny of the one with slimy hair and falling off his broom (like he does every year for some reason).

Another re-read of my most Favorite Dark, clever part of the Series,The Wizarding World expanding, Mysterious Dangerous Prisoner Escaped, A Step in Coming of Age, A Trick with Time...Cat, Rat & Dog.It's where the plot thickens, growing with you to be the Best Series of All Time.PS : I know I sound dramatic, Professor Sybill Trelawney's exaggeration...but I really can't help it.PS 2 : Great portrait for her, also can't help to show it earlier than I should..So, let's see, again as Book One Illustrated Edition Review, Chapter by Chapter review, of how great and perfectly, cleverly this novel written with some small details and fun points you may missed...But before Chapter one... a very clever illustration of Azkaban is introduced Cinematically in every page before the novel start....which keep the Starting of the books itself as mysterious and dark as this part of the series itself.
*** Chapter One ***A History of Magic
Every new book in the series there's a brief ""Previously on Harry Potter"" inserted brilliantly unnoticed to help you catch up... like brief History of the series between lines.And Did you read the ‘History of Magic’ brief essay Harry was writing here? A funny, 
Real
 study on burning witches in the middle ages But from the Wizarding World prospective..You really should check out Harry Potter : A History of Magic, on the Real Life Wizarding World through Ages..And see this cool Broomstick-Care kit… how geekly detailed (written and illustrated) is that.
*** Chapter Two ***Living Hell with the Dursley
Yeah I know Harry is a real “Hot Head” kind of guy… but I just love how he keep obeying the rules of the Dursley… he's too good with them as much as he can, not such a bad example as many bluenoses say..In previous chapter he was studying in the middle of the night under the sheet !! in the dark !! Well, that's count for something.Yet Aunt Marge has a Large mouth indeed… she deserves what happened to her.. I mean with all her Dog, Bitch and puppy talks.So it was just 
Aunt Marge Large Mistake
.... but this large illustration just got too far.., kinda childish.
*** Chapter Three ***Wizarding World Public Transport
And it goes Anywhere, Everywhere..except underwater..it's still just a Bus.. But I love in this chapter the turn of feelings,Of How Harry from thinking he's already an outlaw, a fugitive and will live as outcast..(“I'm Nevil Longbottom”?!! man, Harry got what it takes to be one Haha) to be greeted this warning, forgiving greeting from The Minister for Magic himself… solving everything..What a Night ! And The Knight Bus itself before, What a Ride!.. I still wished for more illustrations though, specially for the bus.
*** Chapter Four ***Living in Diagon Alley
Living in the Wizards motel, Studing outside, in a table at Ice Cream shop in sunny days with a help of its kind owner…Catching up with the new Wizardry World new items in sales..(Broomsticks, the Cars of the Wizardry World)...God I'm in love with that Chapter..Again, aside the Wizarding Pet shop, more Illustration of the Alley needed..

*** Chapter Five ***The Guardians of Azkaban

The whole time so far they mentioned they just called so, The Guards of Azkaban… but in this chapter they finally have a name...and a horrible shape..That was a part of the
 little mystery
 that has been built up, and you peel the cover of it bit by bit.Dark cloaked figures that “Float”... only their claws of hands visible.. how creepy is that..Wonder how their face looks like? All in good time..all in good time..And then..it's the first time we first see the carts that delivers the students from the station to Hogwarts...how it is invisibly pulled? Wait till Book Five, which is Book Three Symmetry Twin.
*** Chapter Six ***Trelawney and Hagrid
Why we never noticed this hard-to-miss-
stylish
 teacher before in previous years?Well.. She answers that right when you first meet her,.. she isn't that socialising with her colleagues and attend feasts and meals in the Great Hall...for her Inner Sight of course, thought that was obvious.And Hagrid..Our New Teacher...what a job man… BUT a tricky-to-deal-with creatures in the first class? Come on..I love Hippogriffs, I do, but not that fast man.

*** Chapter Seven ***Bad Teacher, Good Teacher

From Snape class… the worst kind of teachers…Bullying, favoritism..etcTo the fun class of Lupin.. caring, activity teaching..etc.But let's take a look at the Boggart here… it lurks in the dark places (that can be under bed, in a closet opend a bit.. etc) and it transform to whatever your mind thinks scary… isn't it simply the boogyman theory. You always don't know what's in the darkest corners but you know it's your worst nightmare..I really love this concept, explains a mysterious common fear into something magical, something from this well crafted Wizardry World.
*** Chapter Eight ***Moving Portraits
Always wondered since the first book; when they're going to make a real, better use of them?Here was the answer -and trust me, more useful uses in later books.
*** Chapter Nine ***Open Page 394
A new mystery thrown… where's Lupin.. and what's Snape is doing to him??God, If we can read the clues as plain as Hermione did when she opend page Three Hundred Ninety Four..
*** Chapter Ten ***The Marauders
Well, I'm not talking just about the Map here..  (though I needed BIGGER illustrated page of it, may be folded one as DA in book one).. BUT I'm talking about that we didn't know back when we overheard the conversation in the Three Broomsticks, of the story of how Black killed Pettigrew after betraying James Potter, THAT was actually about
 Three of the Four Marauders
…
*** Chapter Eleven ***F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and Betrayal.
This two chapters are mostly about that.Friendship and betrayal, sometimes you don't know who will betrayed who...as the case of Sirius Black story and the secret keeper story of the previous chapter..Burt sometimes what a friend may call a betrayal, can be just a good intentions deed… On 'Hermione snitching about the Firebolt' I'm talking about..Oh, and in the same chapter;
 Thirteen dine on one table on Christmas eve
….. talk about 
Friends and Betraying
 symbols… (and I needed this scene illustrated so much... it's a Betrayal to not be included)
*** Chapter Twelve ***Expecto Patrounam
Or,
 The importance of keeping Happy Memories in hand
 ….my Patrounas is a cat, thought that was obvious :)
***Chapter Thirteen***Quidditch never been more exciting.
They didn't have a complete Quidditch season in both Book One and Book Two.. did you noticed so? Or even cared with everything going on every end of the previous two years? I don't think so. (-I had to look it up online why Gryffindor didn't won for 9 years, it was 7 in the first book, and I find out that the Internet already full with that question -and good answer seekers :)-)But it's Oliver Wood, our beloved Gryffindor Quidditch Captain’s last year in Hogwarts , so it matters now.And with the Grim Defeat few chapters ago, this chapter with Gryffindor Vs Ravenclaw was really exciting.Till the cliffhanger end.Oh forget, did you noticed that Cho Chang a year older than Harry?
*** Chapter Fourteen ***“Your father did something Snape could never forgive.”“What?”“He saved his life.”
-Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
Since Book One ever wondered how? Sure we did…Here's a finally, 2 years later, a glimpse of how did Harry’s Father saved Snape’s life… yet still Snape isn't grateful as you might think.
*** Chapter Fifteen ***The Quidditch really Matter in this book.
Guess I already told you so....it is since the first game of the year..First time to behold the Cup.. (only later in book 5 will do again, oh the Symmetry.)
*** Chapter Sixteen ***Exams
I always love the ""Exams"" chapter in every book, though it's mostly hasty , just summing up all the exams... so I always wish to have more of it.Trelawney makes her second accurate prediction… but we don't know that yet, only later in this book..Oh and you'll never know what was her first untill much later in Book Five (again, which is Book Three Symmetry Twin.)Oh... and here we say Goodbye -maybe- to Buckbeak.But....that what was the trigger to the Climax of the book..
*** Chapter Seventeen ***Cat, Rat and Dog
Look, no matter how exciting the re-reads of Harry Potter.. I can't never forget the chill I got first time I read this couple of chapters..This CLIMAX, this Jigsaw of a story where all the puzzle pieces fall in one epic, breath-holding, breathtaking at the same time, clever, mystery revealing Chapters..It all starts with ; 
Cat, Rat and Dog
(I'm just in love with the naming of this one)That continues in;
*** Chapter Eighteen ***Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.
The Marauders, Their past story that full of twists.. and the mystery of The Prisoner is clearing now..Still there was more questions but Snape crashed into the present as he did in the past.But everything get cleared when we learn The True-..
*** Chapter Nineteen ***..-Servant of Lord Voldemort
God, A huge revelation that back to the Night when Harry’s parents got betrayed and killed.., and how Harry got his ride in the motorcycle with Hagrid is finally shown in full and clear in the story…(Oh yes, Black been mentioned from the very early beginning..remember?
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,”said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”-Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone)And the Climax chapters end tragically wrong with..-
*** Chapter Twenty ***-..Dark Night despite the Full Moon.
Very dark chapter indeed.Now, take a breath..Remember back when we first read these chapters made us thought that Crockshanks might be Harry’s Father? God, that was wild.(I remember many theories that kept growing till before the release of book 7 that he's actually alive.)Also now we get it that the Sneakoscope , that Harry got at the beginning of this book as a present from Ron, wasn't malfunctioned after all..(Scrabbers was there..dah!)Well, I'd do anything to get a Time Machine so I'd go back and read this mystery all over again with the same excitement and awe I felt with every twist.But why buy a complicated Time Machine when we have…-
*** Chapter Twenty One ***-..Hermione’s Secret , The Time Turner.
Here where you re-read the Climax of the novel, but in 'Back in Time' mode.. and they didn't change anything... everything already happened!I loved the little perfect rules Rowling did for this twist..Technically they didn't change fate… nothing happened have been changed. I just love that.I always love the Time stories..(and this beautiful illustration)But sure it's a tricky plot.And Rowling herself regretted doing it later cause always fans -probably herself too, even the characters in her Wizardry World- would ask What If we used a Time Turner for this or that…She tried in Book Five (symmetry twin) to close the matter of Time Turners..but not until The Cursed Child that it closed once and for all.Well, I believe that's why I will always appreciate it no matter how the hates it get from many fans.
*** Chapter Twenty Two (The Last) ***Symmetry
And always the last Chapter symmetrically with the first..These little things from every Chapter even the first must be concluded here..Sometimes last chapters makes me widely smile.. or have teary eyes -as in the next book- but mostly smile..Remember that the Dursley already watched Black in the news?Ron is Pet-less….after the whole Cat/Rat struggle the whole year..The Grindylow's empty cage,Oh and who send the Firebolt -I know it's obvious when it's a re-readers or those who watched the movie, or those who read with extra Hermione-care..(By the way, why it never thought by anyone that it could be Professor McGonagall again as she got him Nimbus 2000 in book one?)Well, always last chapter is this one where all the little pieces come together… and Harry is off to the Muggle world with the Dursley with happier thoughts…This time we have a line that will make us on fire for book Four…The World Cup for Quidditch is coming this summer..See you there Harry..Mohammed ArabeyThe Illustrated Edition ReadFrom 24 Nov. 2017To 7 Dec. 2017This Review made for the love of the series, the creative, inspiring work it's done in this series, and for the love of all the fellow Potterheads ❤❤❤

The Harry Potter books are a bit of a puzzle. The series started to get into print only twenty years ago. It was initially intended, despite the massive page count of these novels, as a young boy’s read. Today, it’s already the best-selling book series in human history (half a billion copies sold to date), the most translated literary work and, as a result, one of the most read piece of literature in the world, just behind the Bible and neck and neck with Don Quixote (1605). Why is that? I kept asking myself while reading The Prisoner of Azkaban…This third instalment in the series is indeed an excellent sample of Bildungsroman. As in The Philosopher's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, we follow the adventures of a young orphan boy who lives, during summer, in South East England, with his cruel foster parents (a parody of Victor Hugo’s Thénardiers or Dickens’s Murdstones). We also know from the first book — and just from general knowledge — that Harry Potter has magical powers. As the school year begins, he joins his two friends, Ron and Hermione, and goes to Hogwarts, a boarding school for young wizards and witches. The different classes alternate, held by a rather flamboyant staff (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Hagrid, etc.). There’s a Quidditch — magical team sport — championship going on, where Harry is a crucial element (a bit too much of that stuff to my mind). There’s the nasty foolish brat (Malfoy and his gang), with whom he has to struggle. But above all else, there’s a mystery plot going on, that involves Harry and the evil forces the archenemy (Voldemort and his gang) is marshalling against him. Many plot twists and mythological tropes later, and right at the end of the school year, the mystery is lifted (as in Agatha Christie’s novels), and Harry and his friends are victorious.This brief (spoiler-free) summary calls for a couple of comments that might shed some light on a few of the reason why the Harry Potter books kindle so much enthusiasm for so many readers:The setting contributes to a strange sense of realism. The world-building is extensive, but unlike most fantasy novels, set in wholly imaginary worlds, J.K. Rowling manages to structure the surroundings of her books as an in-between. It's a world where people can seamlessly go back and forth between the mundane (Dursleys' house in Surrey, King’s Cross station in London…) and the poetic and imaginary (Diagon Alley, Hogwarts School, the village of Hogsmeade…). This odd sort of magical realism somehow suggests that the magic world is real and unseen rather than merely fictional.The plot framework is identical to that of the first two instalments. Only some characters change, as well as the nature of the mystery Harry needs to solve. It naturally could be seen as a repetitive, almost predictable story. But I suspect that this sort of variation on the same, efficient, firmly established scenario, is part of the pleasure these books provide. The very pleasure children may draw from hearing the same bedside story over and over again, the sheer joy we, as adults, take from watching TV series that develop the same overall plot over and over.Furthermore, the general story isn’t incredibly original: the story of the poor orphan who discovers he has extraordinary powers and eventually becomes a celebrity is very similar to that of Cinderella’s or The Ugly Duckling’s plot. (There's an excellent video with Kurt Vonnegut on the Cinderella-type plot.) But this is, in fact, a story that lets the readers secretly sense or hope that they are more than what they (and others) might think. It's a call to a better Self.Edited to add: note that the plot around Harry Potter is very similar to the one around Luke Skywalker (Star Wars): a lad of humble origins who must fight a monstrous devil, a group of assorted chums, various challenges overcome, the evil defeated against all the odds, etc. People love that story!Whereas most of the characters in the story are well-drawn and colourful (think Hagrid, Hermione, Snape, even Pettigrew — a shrewd invention on Rowling's part), the very character of Harry, even though he is a central figure in the middle of everything else, comes across as somewhat bland and bloodless. In a way, Harry Potter (a common name) is a blank figure, and just as Ulysses, he could say: “my name is Οὖτις (no-one)”. Or in other words: “my name is potentially everyone, including you, faithful reader. I am the mirror of your life.”In the end, the one and (almost) only thing Harry Potter profoundly expresses is his unconditional love for his deceased parents: in a word, a feeling of endless mourning. This, albeit a bit soppy, is perhaps one of the most profound things the Harry Potter novels convey: what is truly magical and precious isn’t the many tricks and spells taught at Hogwarts. It is the past love that, in some way or other, we received at the beginning of our lives and which goes on through friendship.A final note: the best part of The Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the last hundred pages, and especially the story around the Time-Turner device. Alfonso Cuarón's film manages to make the most of it in what is perhaps the best of all the Harry Potter movie adaptations.

“What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
 I found it highly entertaining how obviously teenage our trio were in this book. The arguing, mood swings and first crushes were so on point. I'm glad this is the last of the middle grade books in this series and that from book 4 we move into YA. JKR really knew how to set the spooky vibes and the unsettling atmosphere. This book did have a little of the investigation element that the other books have but not as great as it is in rest. I forgot so much about this book in particular. I did not remember how much slower paced and lacking The first 3/4 were so slow and while I still love every bit of it I needed more to happen. 
“I knew I could do it all this time,” said Harry, “Because I'd already done it... does that make sense?”

shook.
 guys, SHOOK. I just can't function properly rn. like, my brain is still trying to process all the information. everything that went down with sirius black, professor lupin, peter pettigrew, harry, ron, hermione, and snape like OMG. how scabbers was rlly pettigrew this whole time and that sirius wasn't the potters' secret-kepper and how the four of them, black, lupin, pettigrew, and potter, wrote the freaking map. and how they illegally made themselves change into animals. and omfg that one chapter when black was surrounded by the dementors and how they were on the verge of performing the kiss on them but harry stopped them in time with his spell and I kid you not guys, I repeat, I kid you not, I freaking had tears in my eyes. my friends were looking at me like I lost my damn mind. like I'm not even joking with you. I cried b/c well, obviously black is innocent and I rlly didn't want him to die, especially when he offered to have harry move in with him instead of the dursley's. like, he can't die b/c he's freaking harry's godfather. and he bought harry the firebolt as a birthday present and he signed the permission slip for harry to go to hogsmeade like bro, everyone is hella wrong abt black and he's just such an amazing person to harry and is nothing everyone thinks he is. I swear, I hope he's ok and that everything gets cleared up b/c I rlly want him to be ok and not have to be in hiding anymore.and hermione's secret?! she's been going back in time with the little hourglass and how at the end, she and harry went back in time and was able to save buckbeak and sirius black. like bro, I'm shook. and like dumbledore was in on hermione and harry going back in time and how he willingly let sirius black go even though there isn't sufficient evidence that he is, in fact, not guilty. this goes to show that dumbledore truly is a wonderful man. 
“Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git.Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor.Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his hair, the slimeball.” 
k so going back to pettigrew, like screw him and I hated that he escaped. he better die a horrible death and rot in hell. b/c if he doesn't die and rot in hell, he's gonna have a meeting with my fist. professor lupin ends up resigning as defense against the dark arts teacher and I'm just sad. it's not his fault that snape is a freaking bastard. I hated how he had to leave his job. he rlly fit the role and I can't bear to see him leave. all the students obviously loved him and enjoyed his lessons and the fact that he has to leave now that everyone knows he can transform into a wolf and is a danger to everyone just breaks my heart. 
“What you fear most of all is —fear. Very wise...”
so this is like smth I can't ever forget, but hermione legit slapped malfoy in the face for being rude and saying harsh things abt hagrid. like gurl, YOU GO! I 100% was not expecting that and when it happened, I laughed b/c that seems like smth she wouldn't ever do and like wow, just shook me. omg and harry's crush on the ravenclaw's seeker: cho chang. ""harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he FELT A SLIGHT LURCH IN THE REGION OF HIS STOMACH THAT HE DIDN'T THINK HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH NERVES."" bro, harry got GAME! like this here is making me hyperventilate. it's not rlly dirty, but it's dirty to me omg. 
“The ones who love us never really leave us, you can always find them in here.” 
of course, how could I forget? that EPIC save harry did to catch the seeker in their final game against slytherin. like I was so happy and excited for gryffindor and I just can't omg.

Third book....third year at Hogswarts. I think this might be my favorite Harry Potter book yet. It has more psychological depth. The wild adventures are still wizardly enthralling ....but we there are also many emotionally unsettling scenes to grapple with....which has us thinking and feeling deeper. At the start, J. K. Rowling immediately begins by pulling on our heartstrings. It’s summer, Harry’s least favorite season when he’s in the throngs of the unbearable muggle relatives, the Dursleys. It’s Harry’s birthday - and for the first time ever - his friends- Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid give him cards and gifts.....but his relatives wouldn’t even consider such a thing. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looking at Harry suspiciously at every turn - is one thing - bad enough- but when Aunt Marge shows up on his birthday voicing her opinion that Harry was mentally subnormal and displaying other cruel actions - Harry is willing to almost do anything he needs including lie to get what he so desperately needs. Third year students at Hogwarts can sign out to visit Hogsmead on weekends - but first they must turn in a signed permission slip from their caretaker. So Harry makes a deal with his Uncle Vernon - promising to act normal - that’s going to come back and bite him. However - soon enough school starts in September....and the wild ride begins of following the escape of a prisoner Sirius Black. The wizards and muggles are both after him and Harry’s in real physical life or death danger .....but Harry - poor Harry also has to re-live the events leading to his parents murder whenever the dementors get near him. On the flip side Harry learns more about his parents and himself and so do we. Yep.... my favorite so far! The characters are endearingRon was more emotional in this story....Hermione was slightly wonderfully hysterical about studying for her classes......and watching Ron and Hermione go at it was - well was so wizardly-human! Ron thinks Hermione will never admit she’s wrong: squabbling over the Scabbers! I just started to fall in love with these kids more and more.And who knew I could feel excited for a Quidditch match? I did!Thank you .....once again to my friend Lisa for being my Harry Potter inspiration

Nonetheless, one must read this story for the long game if one wishes to make sense of the rest. I am still a bit baffled by the whole switcheroo that Prang & Co did leading to the death of HP's father and mother, but perhaps they will return to that later.

“Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways.” 
Harry grows up through this book, he tries to learn new magic and overcome his fear. Dementors are the symbol Rowling created to stand for your fear in the deepest of your mind, and it quite works for me very well, this creature makes the book gloomy and grey. I loved the scene when (view spoiler)[Harry is fell from his broom. (hide spoiler)], it's everything to me. PERFECTION.And the movie, oh no ! I don't want to talk about the movie on this page but let me. It is very amazing and captivating, I extrememly like about time travel, it's pure magic. For the first time I read this book, I gasped and gasped and gasped and couldn't stop gasping for the ending. It's what I asked for and it's perfect. Trust me, this book is the last book that will leave you feel whole after you finish it. Because in the next one, this feeling will vanish and it's hurt like Avada Kedavra running through your heart !

THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS that amaze me about this book as I read it again as an adult for the first time in years. I've read it many times before but this is the first time I'm like WOW, did J.K. Rowling really plan everything from the beginning?THINGS THAT ARE AMAZING ABOUT THE PRISONER OF AZKABANThe Characters POA introduces some of the most wonderful characters in the entire Harry Potter series - Lupin, Sirius, Crookshanks, Professor Trelawny, Buckbeak - the Dementors! All amazing additions to the wizarding world, as well as the fact that we got to experience more of Cornelius Fudge. I was even surprised that Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory were mentioned. I think it's so great that we already got to see Harry interact with two seemingly minor characters who become focal points in the next novel - though I do absolutely loathe Cho with all my heart, ughh.Harry and Hermione! One of my favourite things about this series is Harry and Hermione's friendship. I was never a shipper of these two because I simply loved their platonic relationship. It's so lovely and makes me squeal - and POA gives us tons of H/H time because Ron and Herm aren't on speaking terms most of the time (aw, cute lil love spats) and Ron is too injured in the last couple of chapters to join them on their incredible mission to save Sirius. The Plot I think, in retrospect, The Chamber of Secrets was such a dud because POA is chock full of exciting plot, surprising discoveries, and great build up for the rest of the books. This is where the ball really gets rolling towards the return of Voldemort and such. This is also the only book in which Voldemort doesn't actually make an appearance and I think that adds to the depth of the plot. It stops being a Scoopy Doo mystery where the bad guy turns up at the end of the episode and is defeated by the gang. Also the whole time turning thing was something I actually couldn't wrap my head around as a kid until I saw the movie where they added a bunch of little moments that helped explain it more. It's so imaginative and complex, and I loved how the Buckbeak/Hermione/Sirius plot points all intertwined.Quidditch & Hogsmeade  I love that we got to see more Quidditch in this book. It's never repetitive, always exciting, and so satisfying that we finally got to experience Gryfinndor's win. Hogsmeade, of course, is a fantastic way to broaden the world building. And J.K. manages to do this so naturally, as if it were always there. Which, of course, it was, because Hagrid won a dragon egg at the Hog's Head in the first book. I AM SO IN AWE OF ALL THE SEEDS J.K. QUIETLY PLANTS IN OUR HEADS.I also had the pleasure of reading this during my trip to London which made everything so much better. Overall, I am blown away by how much excitement has been reawakened in me after so many years.

Dementors are called into Hogwarts for protection purposes and Harry forms a close friendship with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, as the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. Basically, there's lots happening.Okay, so I was pretty sure that Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite HP book in the series, and right now it's leading the charge! The ending of this book broke me and had me in tears. From this point forward I'm just gonna assume whoever is reading this has either read the HP books or has seen the movies - if not, what are you even doing here reading a review for the third book in a series, you psycho?? So there may be spoilers galore!!When I think of PoA, I think of Sirius Black. Sirius is a character who gets a LOT of love on bookstagram, and I always kinda liked him but was never Sirius-obsessed. Well, now I'm concerned as to my emotional state for future events in the series as I am now HEAD OVER HEELS for Sirius. This won't end well. But I am ready to get hurt. (Isn't it weird how on rereads, when we know what's coming, it doesn't lessen the blow and hurt of heartbreaking events?). The reason why I was so bereft at the end of this was just the thought of Harry thinking that he finally had a ""home"" - not the living situation he has had with the Dursleys since the death of his parents, but an actual home - and then it quickly being snatched away again. So I was getting all upset over this until he gets his letter from Sirius and then... his permission slip to go to Hogsmeade and all of a sudden it was happy tears running down my face. HP hitting me with the feels!I also always suffer from major feels when there's any reference to Harry's parents. Hearing Sirius or Remus tell Harry that he is like his father, or for Dumbledore to say that his father is always within him and that ""Prongs rode again last night"", there is no doubt that an emotional breakdown will ensue. I also get weirdly emotional when it comes to any woes that Hagrid must face (wtf is wrong with me), the entire Buckbeak storyline had me sad and anxious (again, even though I knew the outcome). A personal highlight of this book is when Harry and Ron have fallen out with Hermione and Hagrid feels like he needs to step in and mend bridges, telling them how hurt Hermione is by it all. Hagrid, you deserve all the good things in life <3This book also had so many funny parts - the phone conversation between Ron and Mr Dursley at the beginning, watching Hermione struggling with all her subjects and losing her cool a number of times and so forth, Draco dressing up as dementor to scare Harry... Oh, and Hermione punching Malfoy in the face!! YASSS GIRL. Usually I don't condone violence, but Malfoy was being extra dickheady at that point. I also love the time travel aspect and the Marauder's map discovery - so much COOL stuff in this book.Although I refuse to believe that Gryffindor won the House Championship for a third year in a row. MY ASS.To be honest, I'm pretty gutted to come to the end of the illustrated editions, all 3 have been absolutely gorgeous. I think the best artwork has been in this one - for me personally - maybe because the series is starting to get slightly darker, and therefore so does the artwork. I can't wait for the release of the remaining books in the series! Dying to progress with my big HP reread, but taking a slight breather before diving into Goblet of Fire. 5 stars for this one!!

Good s**t is always better than practically anything else we could have tried.Oh, and after all these re-reads, and despite knowing the story so well, I still burst into tears while reading my parts. My girl stared at me each time as if I'd grown another head. Do you know that scene when Harry hid behind the bush at the lake? Yeah. That scene. I swear I made the lake. Teaching this way is definitely the best way.The Other Reviews:I read this as a buddy read, but really I wanted to compare the text to the movies more than anything. I've watched them so much and I've only read the series once through. (Now twice through this third book.)So what do I think about this monstrosity of a series that gets so many hearts a-pumpin? About this book in particular?I love it.But how about this book in comparison to the film, you ask?ALAS! I like the movie better.What??? Blasphemy! Heretic! No no no, give me a chance. I liked the fact that Hermione develops real stressed-out reasons for giving up the time-turner even if the reasons are still rather weak, all told, when taken in conjunction with all the other crap that happens in the series later. It'll always be one of those hedge-moments for me. BUT, putting that aside, the actual narrative events that happen in the book that I think are the best parts, namely the space of a certain 3-hour stretch, BOTH times, were much more fascinating and fleshed out in the movie. Sorry! It's true! All the expressions and the little tidbits and quirks were more brilliant on the screen. And so was the penultimate event that always... ALWAYS brings tears to my eyes... the moment when Harry realizes that he was the one to bring out that awesome power to save himself. Even now I tear up when I think about it.Yes, the book has it, but the build-up was just too quick in the text. The movie, however, did what movies are brilliant at... SHOWING us the enormity of the event. Sometimes it just takes the right media.The movie is my favorite of the series. I'm reserving judgment as to whether the book is as well. (At least until I finish my re-read. :)

This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help. If you still love Harry Potter that’s okay but stop supporting Rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets.

Last week when I posted my bookfessional on special edition books, I’d just started thumbing through this year’s illustrated edition of Harry Potter. Now that I’ve finished . . . WHUH.

Not that that isn't an excellent dementer . . . *shudders*BUT.Then there was Harry furiously completing his homework under blankets, and THE MONSTER BOOK OF MONSTERS, and the first of many illustrations of Crookshanks (my favorite literary cat ever), and a scraggly Fawkes on Dumbledore’s head:


And we were just getting started. *waves at Aunt Marge as she floats away*


I still think last year’s book is beautiful, but Herbology greenhouses, gorgeous as they were, cannot compete with the majestic hippogriff. 


They just can’t. *shrugs*BUT. I’ve learned my lesson about (prematurely) deciding that any of these new versions is the “best.” I mean, come on . . . We haven’t even gotten to HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE yet. *begins the looooooong wait for next year’s book*Verdict: an absolute must for any Harry Potter fan. Even if you're a staunch adherent to the no-multiple-editions school of thought. Gift your lesser versions to the child of a family friend and get these for yourself.

I love the concept of stealing someone's soul through sucking their physical body off its bones.3. Transfiguration is a focus point, and I love seeing people turn into animals. It's like our core is bursting to show itself.4. Remus was my favorite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. He was someone I'd want to hang out with... you know, and be a werewolf and all.5. History is revealed in many family connections and secrets. And since that's my favorite thing... this book was the most eye-opening for me.See, that wasn't so bad to re-read a little bit of Harry Potter. I promise the next one won't be so hard. Only 4 left to write a review for.

I had little to no problem with the time travel element. What hit me most were the cliffhanger tropes at the end of each chapter. You can sense how Rowling crafted each scene. By now we had come to realize that everything is seen through Harry's lenses. At the end everything had a lot of information unfurled to reveal the puzzles written before. This book is usually my most cherished Potter book.

!!!! I love each of them very much. Oh sorry, I forgot to mention Voldemort. But I love him as the villian. This series gets improve with every next installment. From Sorcerer's Stone to Prisoner of Azkaban I don't remember a page which I didn't enjoy.As far as this book is concern, I adored it. Excitement was limitless. Stakes were higher than the previous ones. Even though I was missing Voldemort, I still enjoyed it.
OVERVIEW
Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, a prison for criminal wizards, which no one has broken but him. He is after Harry (view spoiler)[apparently  (hide spoiler)]. He is believed to be the one who helped Voldemort in killing Harry's parents.
 RANDOM THOUGHTS
=>I liked what Harry did to Aunt Marge. Hehehe...=>This book started slowly towards the main plot. There were many Quidditch matches which actually didn't have to do anything with the plot. BUT it's my favourite sport. I love reading it. Privately, I really wish that I could play it. Last year my friend on GR recommended a book entirely based on this sport. In this year, I will read it after finishing this series.=>You know what? During reading, I was thinking 'why Sirius isn't showing up'. There were just talks about him. But in the end, I came to know that, I was reading him all the time but I was ignoring him.=>Dementors were great. I liked the concept of them. And Dementor's Kiss. I literally shivered on the effects of it.=>There was a very shocking revelation. Ron's rat!! What it turned out in the ending was mouth-dropping.Overall, an amazing installment in the HP series.🌟🌟🌟5 Stars🌟🌟🌟P.S. I have read the whole series in the last month. You see? That's the problem when you read books without using Goodreads. Have to write reviews now.June 7, 2017

This held up well! On this read, I'm a little shocked now at how vicious this world of wizards is.

Something like Full Metal Alchemist is haunted so deeply by the ability to create living creatures and chimeras. But Hogwarts? No problem. And that attitude is just everywhere here. Who cares about the implications of a time turner? Who cares if there are only like four Quidditch games a year and the game itself is ridiculous?Anyways, still great, obviously, and the highlight is the details of the wizarding world, as bizarre as they sometimes are. And it's incredible how fast these books flow, picking up momentum.My only major gripe, as always, is that these kids get to go to magic school and most of them can't be bothered to learn magic. Go to class, kids! Go learn magic!

 5 Expecto Patronum stars! I grew up with Harry Potter. Yes, I am that generation. I was a little bit younger than 11 when the books were released, and when the final book was published I had just graduated high school. I'm also the same age as Daniel Radcliffe and he's only older than me by less than a month. I also have a deathly hallows bumper sticker on my car. So, I think it's safe to say that this series has had a profound effect on me, to the point where I am still a little bit bitter that I never got my Hogwarts acceptance letter.A couple years ago I reread the first two books in the series and loved them just as much as when I was a kid. So when I got into a horrible reading slump, I saw my dad watching Harry Potter weekend on ABC Family (as he does for every fucking Harry Potter weekend mind you), I said to myself, what the hell. Time for a reread. So hence, Harry Potter 3 reread. All of us may know the story but I am going to reiterate. In his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns that a dangerous man named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry then overhears the fact that Black is the reason his parents are dead, as Black sold them out to Voldemort and then killed 13 people in broad daylight.  So in a unique part of the review from me, here are all the amazing parts of this book that I forgot because I've been watching the movies instead: -Peeves the Poltergeist: Holy crap how did I forget about this hilarious menacing spirit? He's not as present in this book but he has always had a part in the series and I completely forgot he existed! I know they can't include everything in the movies but I wish Peeves had been included.-Charlie Weasley: Ron had yet ANOTHER sibling that is only mentioned in the films! This one is the cool brother in Egypt.-Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory: there are soooooo many mentions of Cho and Cedric in this book! I never really noticed Cedric until the 4th book where he becomes prominent. And this is the book where Harry's crush on Cho began. Stomach flutters!-More details on Whomping Willow/Shrieking Shack: This may be a spoiler for those of you who haven't read it, but the Whomping Willow was actually planted to hide Lupin's werewolfism as well as the shrieking shack to hide him. I thought this little tidbit was super interesting, along with the details of how Black escaped Azkaban. And just in general, I love JK Rowling's ability to tie things together. There's so much in this book that becomes important later and tiny little details and sharp wit that make me giggle. So in a small factoid, this book is probably my least favorite of the entire series. It's good, obviously, but for some reason I like all the other ones better. The movie, well it's my second to last favorite (just ahead of that godawful Goblet of Fire film which ruined everything but I digress). The movie director added so many unnecessary things that weren't in the book, and I wish he hadn't so he could of kept the good stuff! (And I've heard a rumor that he didn't even read the fucking book until JK kept vetoing all of his weird ideas. Look it up!)If you haven't read these books, do not tell me!!!!! I will smack you!

When I first read Prisoner of Azkaban, I didn't enjoy it as much as the first two books. I saw it as just another adventure of Harry Potter. Even after reading the complete series, I always thought of it as the ""odd man"" in the series, bearing no direct link to it, except for the introduction of a few characters that we meet again. However, this second reading made me realize how blind I've been. I can't totally blame myself, for I didn't know what was yet to come when I first read it, but now, I can see how well Rowling has kept the connectivity and the order of the series. In any case, I see this particular installment as a turning point in the series, where Harry learns all truth regarding his past, accepts it, and prepares for the darker battle that he's about to encounter. And more importantly, he learns that he will have to fight some battles though they seem futile and won't produce the desired end. It is with a shock that Harry realizes that even the great wizard, Professor Dumbledore, cannot ""fix matters and make everything alright."" This realization sheds his childlike innocence and transforms him into a responsible teen who will fight battles far more advanced for him. As a book of its own, this is by far the best written by Rowling. It has a meritable adventure, full of suspense. I read most of the part with bated breath. Here again, Harry and his two friends face yet another challenge where their courage and loyalty are sorely tested. And the threesome shines yet again in their goodness, having saved two innocent lives. Also, with each installment, I'm enjoying the close and tight bond between these three. That's a friendship of ""blood and iron""! I didn't like the two new characters the book introduces in my first reading, but this time, both Lupin and Sirius Black gained my sympathy. The only character I truly couldn't stand here was Professor Snape, and that I believe is a common Potter problem that all Potter fans will understand. :)I truly enjoyed the book this time around. I've under-appreciated it all this time. Now, with an easy heart, I can move on to the next Potter adventure, having enjoyed all three preceding books.

Harry Potter is perhaps one of the most loved series of all time. After turning into a bookworn six years ago, I found myself resisting this series, don't know why. Believe me, I love the movies to bits and pieces, yet I didn't find that something special between me and the books to make me read them. But something happened and I had to read these, at least the first three.I am not going to bore you with what's so special about this book as there are better reviews for that and half of the world know by heart what happened. Instead I will tell you what made me read these books.So after being told numerous times to read HP by Potterheads (90% of my friends are dedicated Potterheads), I didn't budge a millimeter. Then one fine day I decided to take Book Riot's ""Who's your Book Boyfriend?"" Quiz. I was looking for Darcy, Aragorn, or even Jon Snow would have made me happy, but I got Sirius Black. Potterheads took the same quiz and got Darcy (I was so jealous!), Jay Gatsby, and others but none got Sirius Black. Talk about Karma.So I decided it's time to read Harry Potter, at least the first three to meet Sirius Black. After eating out the heads of Potterheads for 70% of the book, I was out of my mind. I was angry. Can you blame me? I was reading the book to meet my BBF and he was nowhere to be seen. I wanted us to spend some quality time together, know each other but I lost hope. Nothing could be done in last 15-20% to redeem him.But but the moment finally arrived when we met. I agree the time we spent together was short but no qualms as he was nice, honest, easy to love. By the time we said our goodbyes, my heart was ""Siriusly Black"". And that's what matters, all my complaints went outta window and I fell in love with my Book Boyfriend. So I find it funny how people change. I used to laugh at my friends for their Sirius devotion and now I snap at anyone who dare to tell me that they love him. I just tell them, ""he is MINE MINE MINE and MINE"".

 I solemnly swear I am up to no good I am probably being very biased here. Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite movie thus I had more fun reading the book whilst imagining the movie scenes itself. From all the nine movies (including the Fantastic Beasts movies) I felt as if the third movie managed to capture the essence of Harry Potter and most importantly of Hogwarts the best. Unfortunately the next book is the one I liked the least. Mostly because from there onward the deaths start to occur. The proper revival of He-Who-Must-Be-Named occurs then (this would be a spoiler to any poor soul who has yet not had the joy of reading Harry Potter. Yet). There is something in reading these books once again when I am older knowing the full length of sadness I would feel, by knowing the end for most of the characters in the series. With full acknowledgement that despite few who find reprieve here ultimately becomes collateral damage in the end. So many essential characters are introduced here, some minor and some very important for the story to proceed. This book has managed to score the highest among the series mainly due to introducing some of characters that have managed to stay in my favorite character list, Sirius and Remus. Now knowing their bond with James and the lengths they would go for their best friend's son, pains me. Suddenly a kind of sadness that I had never felt before, managed to overtake me. Specially thinking back to the bygone days of Prongs, Padfoot, Moony and even Wormtail, who spent their teenage years dreaming of a future for all four of them, dreaming of growing old together. It occurred to me to imagine what they would have felt when making the Marauder's Map. Maybe they were thinking of the legacy of mischief makers they've leave, not knowing the grim future for them. It is just so sad to imagine, these cheerful, mischievous children, that by the end of the series, all gone, to save each other, not themselves. All died selflessly (mind you I am NOT including Peter Pettigrew). These thoughts kept running through me. The futures of all of them lost. If the prophecy was not made, they would have lived better lives. Yet, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was not sent away because of the actions of prophecy, they still would have died. At least they would have died knowing there was someone for them, one of the three. In a way, this is children's novel but the implications of the story are greater. Despite being a children's novel the realistic points of the plot which do go hand-in-hand with tyrannical rulers in the world is quite interesting. For us, whatever is happening to others in the world is merely passing information on the 8 o'clock news but in reality it is the cruel reality to some. Many suffer faiths like this, losing parents, losing loved ones, losing whole futures and the repercussions that follow that. It is not with any joy that I bring about such harsh words in such a simple review but I felt that we should remember, what truly matters. Insensitivity should not be encouraged and we should not take what we have for granted.Till once again, Mischief Managed

It's exciting to see our Harry grow that way and face the consequences of his actions, but guys, what could be worse than the Dursleys? !

“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”

 I've loved the dementers, I think they are a great addition to the plot , I don't know if they reappear later or not, but they have brought a creepy touch to the story. I believe, that like these new villains, like any dark force that attacks Harry manages to make the best of him, I mean ,in terms of magic , those moments where shows his power and his courage, are thanks to this kind of villains who are amazing and are very well described.At first I was somewhat irritated by the absurd fights between Hermione and Ron, I was so angry with them !. I haven't stopped love them, I couldn't , but guys, really?.On the other hand I really liked Hermione's rol in this book, she revealing her secret, helping Harry and everything they spend together, I think their friendship has grown even moreIn fact my favorite chapters of books are about they.The revelations in this book are incredible, everything about Sirius Black and Lupin left me shocked, I did not expect anything like that and I loved it !.one of the things I enjoy the most, is to know more about Harry's parents and how has been the past in Hogwarts!

“Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”

 I'm like I said before excited to continue the saga soon, is a, magical incredible story with solid characters and a stunning world, never ceases to amaze me! : D.
I want to know more about the secrets that this history hidden , I have the feeling that there are many more to discover.

I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape. Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. I think this is my favorite of all the Harry Potter books thus far. This is the one that introduces Sirius Black, who I sometimes loathe (only sometimes!) and Remus Lupin, who I will always, always love. And of course, this is the book that gave us one piece of Severus Snape's background. And that was the infamous Prank that may or may not have destroyed Snape's trust in Dumbledore. Would you have trusted someone who didn't at least suspend the one who'd tried to kill you? I don't think so. This is also the book where I found myself looking at Dumbledore with a new eye. He's a crafty old fella, I tell you that. He'll do anything to gain his means, regardless of how he may personally feel on the matter. Grandpa Albus, he ain't. And Severus Snape, my heart did bleed for thee.

Seriously, don't read this review if you haven't read the books. The biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer. This book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry’s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like “We can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing, and we’ve been doing A LOT. But don’t worry, we’ll see you soon, we just can’t tell you when”? As if he hasn’t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what’s going on, it’s Harry. Doesn’t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does? And that’s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn’t infallible. James Potter isn’t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn’t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that’s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George’s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don’t get the sense that Sirius’s death was a righteous one. You don’t get resolution. He didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I don’t necessarily ""enjoy"" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest

Rowling did an amazing job with the character of Umbridge...never have I hated a fictional character more than I hated her. I do have to admit, I'm curious to see whether she makes any more appearances or not. For me, this book was stronger for character development than plot. Yes, this is a key book for the series, but I felt like most of the book was spent with characters' internal issues and development rather than the plot. I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death. As with all of her books, I have a really difficult time putting these books down, but especially within the last 100 pages, I physically could not separate the book from my hands. Overall, another outstanding addition from J.K. Rowling.

The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting.""Ask us no questions and we'll tell you no lies,""We've finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn't for Rowling's writing, this might've felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would've been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything's put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the 'Last-is-Best' still to be true.""Youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young...""

And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next: 2. Dumbledore’s Army- Harry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they’ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point. 3. Luna Lovegood- because the weird people are always the best people. Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant. The world needs more Luna Lovegoods. I always thought she had far more chemistry with Harry than Ginny ever did.

So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius...

So this is my second favorite book of Harry Potter. And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry.
⭐️Interlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst Phase
Harry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. 
Return To Actual Review
J.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU” This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.This book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.

English (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix) / Italiano«The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four»The ""big number 5"", the longest novel of Harry Potter series, begins... ""HolyMadonna, how big is this book?"" my daughter says, without fear for the number of pages, she looked more excited for the opening of this new adventure. And it starts with a bang, with two dementors attacking Harry and his cousin Dudley in a muggles area, out in the open. The rules of the usual Rowling's game have definitely changed. . The axiom ""before we'll be between the welcoming arms of Hogwarts, and after many things will happen"" no longer exists. The previous chapter of the series, also, started in the spirit of this new trend: you're not safe anywhere. Everything is more complicated for Harry Potter, it is difficult even to sleep by now.«There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there»Let's talk frankly, the entire novel revolves around this room and what's on it, and there are numerous signs and things said that make me think that we will be back on the argument in the future. In fact, despite a series of revelations came about this room at the end of the novel, an air of mystery remains.And sadness remains too. So much sadness.Vote: 9«Il giorno più caldo dell'estate – almeno fino a quel momento – volgeva al termine e un silenzio sonnacchioso gravava sulle grandi case quadrate di Privet Drive. Le automobili di solito scintillanti sostavano impolverate nei vialetti e i prati un tempo verde smeraldo si stendevano incartapecoriti e giallognoli, perché l'irrigazione era stata proibita a causa della siccità. In mancanza delle loro consuete occupazioni – lavare l'auto e falciare il prato – gli abitanti di Privet Drive si erano rintanati nella penombra delle loro case fresche, con le finestre spalancate nella speranza di indurre una brezza inesistente a entrare. La sola persona rimasta all'aperto era un adolescente che giaceva lungo disteso sulla schiena in un'aiuola fuori dal numero quattro»Comincia il ""big 5"" di Harry Potter, il volume più lungo della serie. ""O Madonnamia quanto è gigante"", dice mia figlia quando lo vede, per nulla spaventata dalla mole, anzi eccitata da questa nuova avventura che sta per iniziare. E comincia col botto, con due dissennatori che aggrediscono Harry e il cugino Dudlley in piena terra babbana, alla luce del sole. Sono definitivamente cambiate le regole del gioco della Rowling al quale eravamo abituati in precedenza, ossia prima si arriva tra le accoglienti mura di Hogwarts e poi succedono tante cose. Non più. Già il capitolo precedente della saga era iniziato all'insegna del nuovo trend potteriano: non si è più al sicuro da nessuna parte. Per Harry è tutto sempre più complicato, gli riesce difficile perfino dormire in santa pace.«Nell'Ufficio Misteri c'è una stanza che viene tenuta sempre chiusa. Contiene una forza al tempo stesso più meravigliosa e più terribile della morte, dell'intelligenza umana e della natura. E forse il più misterioso fra i molti soggetti che vengono studiati laggiù»Parliamoci francamente, l'intero romanzo ruota attorno a questa stanza e a quello che contiene, e ci sono molteplici indizi e mezze frasi dette che mi fanno pensare che si ritornerà a parlare di essa, tentando di chiarirne l'essenza misteriosa, che però permane nonostante tutta una serie di rivelazioni a fine romanzo.E permane tristezza. Tanta tristezza.Voto: 9

❝Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.❞

Rating: ★ ★ ★ ¾I feel like I'm going to get attacked for only rating a Harry Potter book 3.75 stars but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is probably my LEAST favorite of the series thus far. It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.

Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.

Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.

We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.

What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter, #5), J.K. RowlingThe novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix follows Harry Potter's struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic. During the summer, Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Forced to use magic to fend them off, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. Harry is whisked off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the childhood home of Sirius Black, by a group of wizards belonging to the Order of the Phoenix.Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley and Fred and George Weasley learn that Voldemort is seeking something he lacked prior to his defeat. The Ministry, led by Cornelius Fudge, refuses to accept Voldemort's return, and are running a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Dumbledore defends Harry, who is cleared of all charges.At Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She refuses to believe in Voldemort's return, and clashes with Harry, punishing him by having him magically carve ""I must not tell lies"" into the back of his hand. She also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive magic, prompting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence group with other students. Umbridge, empowered by the Ministry to interfere in Hogwarts as the new High Inquisitor, bans unapproved clubs, forcing the group, now called Dumbledore's Army, to meet in secret in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس»؛ «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش در ماه دسامبر سال2003میلادیکتاب پنجم «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس» از سری «هری پاتر»، که با ترجمه ی جناب آقای «فریدون قاضی زاده» و سرکار خانم «نفیسه ی سلطانی»، با ویرایش سرکار خانم «نسیم عزیزی» در872صفحه، و با چهار تابلوی رنگی از هنرپیشه های فیلم، توسط نشر روزگار، با جلد شمیز چاپ شده است، قیمت کتاب با جلد شمیز50000ریال، همین کتاب، با عنوان «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس» در سه جلد با ترجمه ی سرکار خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»، با جلد گالینگور، توسط کتابسرای تندیس نیز، چاپ و منتشر شده است؛ قیمت سه جلد جمعا98000ریال است؛ دو ترجمه را مقایسه کردم، هر دو ترجمه خوب بودند، رقابتی بیهوده برای ...؛ اگر در یکی از برگردانها اشکالی بود، باز میشد، خود را به کوچه ی دیگری رساندپنجمین کتاب از مجموعه ی داستان‌های هفت گانه ی «هری پاتر»؛ نوشتهٔ سرکار بانو «جی.کی رولینگ» است؛ این کتاب طولانی‌ترین رمان این سری است، و نسخه ی «آمریکایی» آن در870صفحه، و ترجمه فارسی بانو «ویدا اسلامیه» نزدیک به1250صفحه است؛ ماجرای این رمان، پس از بازگشت «لرد سیاه» روی می‌دهد؛ جمعی از جادوگران، گروهی را به ریاست «آلبوس دامبلدور»، با نام «محفل ققنوس» تشکیل میدهند، تا برای مبارزه با «ولدمورت» آماده شوند؛ این کتاب یکی از سیاه‌ترین، و تلخ‌ترین ماجراهای «هری پاتر» است؛ هشدار: اگر داستان را هنوز نخوانده اید و میخواهید بخوانید، ادامه ریویو، داستان را لو میدهددر پایان کتاب، «رولینگ»، خوانشگرانش را، با سازمان اسرار آشنا می‌سازد؛ که بسیار شگفت انگیز است؛ در وزارت سحر و جادو، نبرد اعجاب آوری بین «لرد ولدمورت» و «آلبوس دامبلدور»، روی می‌دهد؛ و سرانجام خوانشگران درمی‌یابند، که «ولدمورت»، برای پیشگیری از پیشگویی، که «سیبل تریلانی (یکی از استادان پیشگویی مدرسه هاگوارتز)» در آن اعلام کرده بود، که تنها کسیکه می‌تواند «ولدمورت» را، شکستی ابدی بدهد، در واپسین روز ماه «ژوئیه» به دنیا میآید، و پدر و مادر این پسر، پیش‌تر، سه بار در برابر «ولدمورت» ایستادگی کرده‌ اند؛ در این داستان «دلورس آمبریج»، که از وزارت سحر و جادو، برای تدریس درس «دفاع در برابر جادوی سیاه»، در مدرسه «هاگوارتز» برگزیده شده‌، رفته رفته از سوی وزارت سحر و جادو، رتبه‌ اش بالاتر می‌رود؛ او قوانین دشواری در مدرسه برقرار می‌کند؛ او به عنوان تنبیه، «هری پاتر» را وادار می‌کند، که با خون خودش، روی دستش حک کند، که: «من نباید دروغ بگویم»؛ در اواخر داستان، «فرد» و «جرج ویزلی»، از مدرسه جادوگری «هاگوارتز»، فرار می‌کنند، و با این فرار، نام خود را زبانزد خاص و عام می‌کنند؛ در این شماره از مجموعه داستان‌های «هری پاتر»، نگهبان مدرسه «هاگوارتز»، «هاگرید»، با خانم «ماکسیم»، به ماموریتی، برای صلح، میان غولها به سفر می‌روند، و با «گراوپ»، برادر «هاگرید» که غول است، حتی نمی‌تواند به زبان انسان‌ها سخن بگوید، برمی‌گردند؛ «هاگرید» از «هری»، و «هرمیون (هرماینی)» درخواست می‌کند، که به برادرش الفبا را، یاد بدهند؛ در پایان داستان، «بلاتریکس لسترنج»، پدر خوانده ی «هری»، یعنی «سیریوس بلک» را، به قتل می‌رساند، «آلبوس دامبلدور» نیز، با «لرد ولدمورت»، در وزارت سحر و جادو، درگیر می‌شوند و میجنگند؛نقل متن از کتاب دوم برگردان خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»: (ماه دسامبر که از راه رسید، برف بیش‌تری به همراه داشت، و بهمنی از تکالیف، برای دانش آموزان سال پنجمی، به ارمغان آورد؛ با نزدیک شدن «کریسمس»، وظایف ارشدی «رون»، و «هرمیون» سنگین‌تر می‌شد؛ به آن‌ها گفته بودند، که بر تزیین قلعه، نظارت کنند (رون می‌گفت: «درست موقعی که آدم می‌خواد ریسه ‌های پرزرق‌وبرق رو ببنده، بدعنق یه سر دیگه شو می‌گیره، و می‌خواد با اون آدمو خفه کنه.»)، و مراقب باشند تا دانش آموزان سال اوّل و دوم، زنگ تفریحشان را در قلعه بگذرانند، چرا که هوا سرد و سوز دار بود (رون می‌گفت: «نمی‌دونی چه بچه پرروهایی هستن، کی ما وقتی کلاس اول بودیم، اينقدر رومون زیاد بودا») و به نوبت با «آرگوس فیلچ»، در راهروها سرکشی کنند، زیرا «فیلچ» تصور می‌کرد، ممکن است، حال و هوای تعطیلات باعث شود، بچه‌ ها با هم دوئل کنند (رون با خشم گفته بود: «توی کلّه‌ش به جای مغز، پهنه!»)؛ کارشان آنقدر زیاد بود، که «هرمیون» بافتن کلاه، برای جن‌های خانگی را، کنار گذاشته بود، و غرغر می‌کرد، که فقط سه کلاه دیگر برایش مانده است.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 22/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

There's blackout here ;_;  4.9 Stars 
'Yeah' said Harry, 'but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.' 
I supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually...okay let's begin with Cho Chang. 
I Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho Chang
I totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much :   ➜ He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. ➜ 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' ➜ 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.➜ 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' ➜ 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -''I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -''Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.'I wasn't going to! she shouted.'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.''Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. ➜ 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?''I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly,'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : ❤ Ginny is funny ❤ Ginny is not a crybaby ❤ Ginny is brave ❤ Ginny is more beautiful than Cho❤ She is basically more perfect than Cho 
I Don't Like Harry's Temper 
I know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione.  'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly.'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.'There was a short pause.'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice.'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking.oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rudeI know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius! 
I Love Sirius Especially Young Sirius
With another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed.OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! ❤❤P.S. I like Luna so much! she is funny xD

hrrmmpp.This is my least favourite of the Harry Potter series, and almost borders on the ""don't bother"". It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.My issues with it:- deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner- characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who's good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt. - Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil. And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry's ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy's silliness. - the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas. - the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what's with Grawp and the freaking giants??Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series.

I’ve been reading it for SO LONG. The notes I took at the beginning have long since disappeared and I just can’t remember vast swaths of this book. This might be a review of the last 200 pages.Okay, the extreme Ravenclaw in me is coming out here - WHY DON’T HARRY AND RON EVER DO THEIR HOMEWORK? I swear to God the sub-plotline in the middle of every single book is them falling behind in their classes, and it stresses me out. Get on top of your work!And then every once in awhile, the stakes will be way higher...and these boys still apply the same procrastination to it. It happened in Goblet of Fire, when Harry would put off working on the task hints - WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIVINATION DREAM CHARTS. And it happened in this book, when Harry just...didn’t try at Occlumency. I know you don’t like Snape, kid. Neither do I. In fact, my list of notes for my anti-Snape rant just kept growing through this book. BUT IT’S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF COUNTLESS OTHERS! PEOPLE YOU LOVE!And poor Ron in this book, right? He finally gets good at Quidditch - good at something - and there’s no one there to see him. His brothers leave him at school. Harry just...freaks out at him sometimes. Things are always rough for poor unappreciated Ron, but this is particularly tragic. And don’t even get me STARTED on Neville in this book. The Gryffindor in him really comes out. His life is so hard, and he is still so brave and loving. Oh my God, I’m legitimately getting choked up.Well, not actually. But as close as I get. And disclaimer, 25 percent of that sadness is because “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” just came up on my Spotify and LA LA LAND IS AN EMOTIONAL FILM.Rating this book is going to be a struggle. I didn’t enjoy the first 600 pages, like, at all. And then I goddamn loved the last 200. Oh god. Now I have to both delineate why the first 600 pages - which I can barely remember - were bad, while the last 200 were good.Alright, I’ll try to do this quickly because clearly I’m ramble-y tonight. The first 600 pages were a terrible combination of boring AND upsetting. I’m still surprised by how Grimmauld Place managed to be such a snoozefest. A secret rebel order of wizards inhabiting a hidden house filled with dangerous relics manages to make me doze off? Unreal. Then we have to watch as a world we all hold dear is torn apart by terrible leadership - Umbridge, yes, but I also think we don’t discuss Minister of Magic Fudge’s incompetency enough.As if that weren’t enough, all these fabulous characters we know and love are at their WORST in this book. I won’t go off on Snape yet, but I’ll explain for the others. Harry is a massive brat throughout. Hermione, my absolute fave, is a bad friend, pretentious and untrusting the whole time. Hagrid has his head particularly shoved up his ass. Dumbledore acts like an idiot, a self-admitted idiot. And Sirius ruins himself for me in this book. When he says, “You’re less like your father than I thought [...] The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James,” he is shaming a fifteen year old, guilting him into acting against his own interest and safety by bringing up his DEAD FATHER. Disgusting.DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE JAMES FLASHBACK. Lupin and Sirius’s speech to Harry on it? Seriously. Lacking. James and Lily should never have ended up together, never. I get why Sirius and James were so close. THEY BOTH SUCK. But there were bright sides. Neville and Ginny are absolutely fantastic in this book, and did their best to rescue it from itself. But Luna is eh for me. I just don’t care about her. AND WE LOSE FRED AND GEORGE. I didn’t realize how much I loved their hijinks until they ruckus’d their way out of Hogwarts.But if the first 600 pages were one, one and a half stars, the last 200 were four and a half or five. I love the setting of the Department of Mysteries, I loved that big Death Eaters battle scene. I sort of liked Dumbledore’s speech, but still was kind of like...okay buddy, you should know what the Right Thing is. Most importantly, I felt like Harry’s mourning at the end was really well captured. Which is, you know, not an impression I get often from these books. (The Harry Potter series isn’t renowned for, like, its capturing of the human experience.) And that last moment at the train station? Where all of Harry’s loved ones are defending him? Killed. Me.Bottom line: I don’t know what to rate this, so I’ll give it that old placeholder, three stars. Not my favorite Harry Potter book, but featuring some of my favorite moments...alongside some of my least favorite.

Her storytelling is the perfect blend of humor, sadness, suspense and pretty much everything else that makes a good book, and it's going to be something I will highly miss once I finish this wonderful series.One might think that the fifth book in a series doesn't bring much new stuff to the overall plot and might even just be written to prolong the finale, but this is not the case here. The story that gets told helps to establish and develop so many things - no book of the series has been a filler so far! Despite the book being so long (my copy has 800 pages), no line is boring or unnecessary. I didn't even feel like I read so many pages, because it was so entertaining.Like in my review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I need to praise the portrayal of friendship! These characters are just normal teenagers with normal conflicts and fights, and I'm so happy that (besides all the fantastical elements) these ordinary things find a place in the story as well. This makes this adventure so much more special, because you truly see these characters grow up and learn!

“Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.”
It's been a long and hot summer and Harry is anxious to know what Voldemort has been up to now that he is in full power. Back at Hogwarts Harry is not a favourite person as everyone believes him to be a liar. But as least he has the support of his good friends, Ron and Hermione. The Ministry of Magic has taken it upon themselves to make sure Harry and Dumbledore don't spread more ‘lies’ about the return of Voldemort. And so the students of Hogwarts are forced to be taught by Professor Umbridge. A ministry official who refuses to teach them how to properly defend themselves and has authority to interfere in the way things are run at Hogwarts. Harry and a few fellow students decide to take their education into their own hands. The first time I read this book I didn't think much of it. But then (during a summer holiday where it was the only book I had with me) I read it multiple times after that and quickly started to see its brilliance. I think this book is underrated. I know many people hate this one because of Harry's outbursts and moods. I however thought Order of the Phoenix was one of the best because of those reasons. It would have been unrealistic if Harry was normal after his experience in the graveyard and after Cedric's death. And also people tend to complain that YA characters are unrealistic but then are irritated when they're moody. Make up your minds! My favourite scenes were the ones spent in the Room of Requirement. I just loved everything about the DA. I think Harry would be an amazing Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.Umbridge will always be that one character I hate above everyone else. She is the most despicable person and I hate her even more than Voldemort.  “Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.” Just the thought of the end of this book fills me with sadness. Poor Harry just can't catch a break. Throughout this whole book he has to deal with people treating him like crap and being told he is a liar and an attention seeker. And then on top of that (view spoiler)[he loses his only parent figure. (hide spoiler)]This book was probably one of the first times I'd read about mental illness, as I was 12/13 when I read it. Don't know how Harry deals with everything, I'd probably be crying in a corner. • Buddy read with You-Know-Who •

This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling's.She never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems?Likewise her world is poorly defined. She did not start by constructing the 'wizarding world' and then base her stories off of it, rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn't make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it.Her fractured plots are not the result of 'realism', which some authors use to create a sense of a 'real world', separate from archetypes. Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book.She has problems connecting the many dots of her story, but uses her magical 'plot devices' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: ""move along, nothing to see here"".I find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to 'graduate' from Potter to writing adult mysteries. A mystery needs to have a tight plot, based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. Though many people tried to 'figure out' the Potter books and predict them, in truth there is nothing to figure out. Rowling's foreshadowing is vague and unsupported, and there are just as many clues as red herrings. The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun. Combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot, and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. She is a slave to her own sentimentality. Then again, so are millions around the world.The only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. They connect us to the magical world, so that even if it doesn't make sense, at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it.Her characters are vivid, emotional, motivated, and archetypal without being banal. They may not be psychologically deep, but for a monomyth like this, that is hardly the point. Most people aren't that complex, either.In the series, this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. Before this, Rowling was still trying to get her footing, figuring out what exactly she was writing, and trying to explain the world to her readers. She finally hit her stride in 'Prisoner of Azkaban', and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in 'Goblet of Fire'. This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package, which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. This is the first, and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series.Instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters, Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. The change is the most apparent in Harry himself, and though his transformation is somewhat sudden, it is still honest and believable for the character.By focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth, if only for a moment, Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.My Fantasy Book Suggestions

Edit #2: 25\7\2014So I came across this article today, and for some reason, it made me happy!! I feel evil *evil laugh* http://mea-news.net/en/index.php/2014...  Edit #1: 8\3\2014It has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^ Remember, this is not a benign cause. 6/11/2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasn’t very free recently, and well because I didn’t know what to either say or on what book should I post it. And then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive. Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don’t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is “your opinion”.Do you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true – even if I was wrong to many other people – and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me. All right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I don’t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time. Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punished… just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself. No review of mine has been removed, but a lot of people’s reviews have been removed. Since it didn’t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesn’t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put  before  the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites. You, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels. If I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law “You can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!” GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager. Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist. Kung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon Manager’s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end. This policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldn’t be called authors if they can’t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not. The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, don’t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldn’t threaten us. You shouldn’t condemn us. Maybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this. I had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly. Us, readers, and the ones who write a bit like I do, find words our strongest weapon. Back to my review about this book. THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ! I have cried 50 pages straight. (view spoiler)[ why did she have to kill Sirius?WHAT DID HE EVER DO TO HER? I AM STILL CRYING YOU KNOW!  (hide spoiler)]The 5 stars I have given it, it was not a “WOW I LOVED THIS BOOK AUTOMATIC FIVE STARS!” No. It was this kind of books “it deserves 5 stars, with a little dash of wow at the end”. This is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness, innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world, and until everything in the book is fixed, nothing in the world will ever be right again. I have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book, but it all goes down to one point. It is good. It is worthy of five stars. And it had hooked me up five days straight.

It’s about time the Dursleys learned their lesson. * I didn’t bother taking notes of the things the movie missed or gotten wrong because there are just too many but I have to say the Umbridge actress played the character spot on and so did Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix and of course Voldz. One thing I commend the movies for from the first one up to the fifth would be the choice of actors and actresses who gave justice to their characters.^^  Goodbye, real world! Hello, wizarding world! *poof!*

I don't even have words for how much I LOVE this book. It's second in the series, to Deathly Hallows in my favourites list I just love it so much Everything about it makes me so happy. Why? Well first of all, there's leaps and bounds in terms of plot development. Things are starting to get dark, they're starting to get serious and it sets the tone for the next two books to come. I love Harry coming to take on his role as ""The Chosen One""Secondly, side characters! Thanks to the DA, we get to see soo much more of the school aside from the golden trio. Neville, Luna, GINNY, Fred and George, Dean, Seamus, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Cho and soo many other characters who I just adore SHINE and it makes me so happy. I love the side characters as much as the trio and they get so much more screen time (page time?) then in earlier booksSO MANY COOL SCENES: I mean, the Weasley escape, the interview in three broomsticks, every DA meeting, Harry's first date, THE QUIDDITCH PITCH BRAWL, Umbridge being taken by Centaurs, the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore and Voldermorts epic duel ! There are so many scenes to love in this one. Literally iconic scenes like DA and the Weasley's leaving school can be exclusively found in ootp and I love them so much. I also just think OoTP is SO funny? I mean, the whole school rioting against Umbridge, the twins pranks, the DA meetings, the things said about Harry / that Harry says back. I laugh out loud when I'm reading this book, and I don't usually properly laugh when I'm reading. I literally just don't understand how anyone can not like ootp. I mean, beside the very sad events at the end, it's perfect. And EVEN that sad event (view spoiler)[RIP SIRIUS ORION BLACK YOU DESERVED BETTER (hide spoiler)] gives us such a beautiful moment between Albus and Harry, that is sad, but also so incredibly human and heartbreaking and such an insight into the humanity and love that drives Harry's character it's amazing. anyway, tbh it's harry potter I shouldn't have to say much I loved reading this with all my heart, obviously.

4 out of 5 stars for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the 5th book in the original 7 book ""Harry Potter"" young adult fantasy series published in 2003 by J.K. Rowling. I cannot believe this is over 15 years old, as I think about what I want to put in my review. Given it's HP, and everyone does review on it, I'm keeping it short. A few things I loved about this book:1. Dolores Umbridge is awesome. Awesome as a villain, that is. She brings out the worst in so many people, and other then the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort, Harry needs a foil on a day-to-day basis.2. More dementors! Those have always been one of my favorite parts. And to see Harry protect his cousin Dudley... well that's just cool!3. The whole Pollyjuice potion usage at the trial is awesome.4. Snape's history is slowly unveiled.5. It sets them on the battle against the Dark One to end all battles in the next couple of books!

Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime). However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets. I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters. This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help. If you still love Harry Potter that’s okay but stop supporting Rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets. Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience.PS. I have this on the signed section because my copy is signed by Daniel Radcliffe (who in my head is now the real author of Harry Potter anyway):

A lot of people consider The Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book in the entire Harry Potter series. I haven't read the last two installments yet, but from what I have read so far ... this one was my favorite. I enjoyed two other books in the series more than this one (The Sorcerer's Stone and The Goblet of Fire), but enjoyment is not necessarily the only aspect allowing a book to turn into a favorite.Let's go on the dark side here. While the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines, this one consisted to approximately 95% of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved. Studying at Hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore, life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere, favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones, dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet. Life is not easy for Harry Potter and his friends in this book, because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up. Not only because of the darkness of the various themes, but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children's book anymore. Justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book. Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament, but nobody truly acknowledges his victory. He still has to spend the summer with his merciless family, he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity. After everything Harry achieved, life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors, the Dark Lord's return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness. This book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the Harry Potter universe, Dolores Jane Umbridge. Who could possibly like such a woman? Apart from imagining Imelda Staunton's inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring Dolores' role in the book, her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances, it can be discussed whether Dolores Umbridge is truly a realistic character, but she supported J.K. Rowling's general direction into the dark themes of the series, and if there is one thing Dolores Umbridge's presence was good for, then it is this: It made Harry and his friends, but also the book's readers realize that life is never the way you imagine it to be. Life is cruel, life is hard, life is merciless.I love this book because it doesn't beautify things. Death is presented as a necessary part of everyone's life. All the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes. The perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like Albus Dumbledore, James Potter or even Sirius Black are shattered in the course of the book, only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again. Those books are set in the fantasy genre, but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the characters felt so realistic. They are flawed. They are full of emotions. They come to decisions, and they regret decisions. But in their essence, they are human. Which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you.[Major spoiler for this novel: (view spoiler)[I am not even angry with J.K. Rowling for killing off Sirius Black. Obviously, he was a character beloved by a lot of readers, and I would have loved to see Sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of. But that's the very reason for why this is my favorite novel in the series so far: Just like in real life, it's not a given that the good people survive and the bad people die. You can't even always say who is good and who is evil, because there is a thin line because good and bad. (hide spoiler)]]A lot of fantasy authors tend to kill off the antagonists and create a happy ending with the good-hearted major characters, which is my main reason for my troubles with the fantasy genre. J.K. Rowling doesn't mind all this; with her novels, you never know who is going to survive and who is going to die, because it could be everyone. As long as you haven't been spoiled already, that is.Yes, maybe this book is too long indeed. I needed more days to finish it than I needed for all the other four books combined (considering only the respective reading time I spent with them). Yes, maybe it could be shortened, although I am the last one who knows how that could possibly be done. Yes, it is darker than all the other books in the series so far. And yes, I loved it for all those reasons.

-----------Pre-Review (4th July):It has been three months since I finished Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and only now do I finally begin reading this fifth book in the series. (Which I am reading for the first time. Can this confession become even more embarassing?)Maybe it can be accepted as an explanation that I left the fourth book feeling like this and obviously needing to recuperate:So, let's continue my journey through the world of Hogwarts!Review to come once I'm finished. Which might take a while, because while it's evidently Harry Potter and shouldn't take much time to get through, my copy of this book has 1040 pages. That's loooong. And, of course, a pretty good thing, considering that it's Harry Potter we talk about.My reviews in the Harry Potter series:1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review3) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: Go to review4) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Go to review

He never knows before his act will bring him to M.o.M. In the beginning, J.K. Rowling used the first few chapters to introduce us about the Order of the Phoenix. That got me chilled the first time I was reading about this order. I loved to see the good guys being together and figthing the Dark Lord. I was so excited about this book anyway.I have a feeling that Harry in this book is not like Harry, the one I know, he throws a tantrum when his friends don't believe about what happened last year. I understand about his age making him not stable, if I can call it. The only person I want to talk about is Professor Umbrige, I call her the pink toad, she's the character that unify everything around this book impeccably. Seeing everyone fighting with her and restraining her not to destroy the Hogwart's system make this book unique unlike the first four books. I couldn't stop laughing then.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?""""Yes.""""You called her a liar?""""Yes.""""You told her He Who Must Not Be Named is back?""""Yes.""""Have a biscuit, Potter.” 
I laughed out loud because of this scene. This book contains many emotions I can't describe all of it in one review. Do you believe me ? It is far better than the movie and the last M.o.M. scene is beyond exciting. The movie cut it out and I was so angry for that !
“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...” 
The sad thing in this book is about Sirius. If you've read it, you'll know why. Every time I get my head around it, I want to cry and cry. It's so touching and heartwrenching to see that thing happens. Nonetheless, reading this book is like growing up. There's not only happiness in your life, you have to face so many regrets and learn how to move on like Harry and his friends. All I can say is this book is not just a book, it's my life !More at http://goo.gl/GMGytx

His expression was calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.”Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix follows a world where Lord Voldemort has officially returned. Harry is starting his fifth year in a world where his influence is everywhere in the Wizarding World and his followers are quickly returning to his side. In response, the Order of the Phoenix, a group created during the first war to stop him, has gathered together again, now with some new members. Problems are showing up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are meddling in everything. Harry also has a powerful connection to Voldemort, which seems to be growing even stronger, and he soon realizes that he has direct access to the Dark Lord’s mind. It’s time for Harry and his friends to take action, but the course they choose will have terrible consequences.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my second favorite book in this series, despite a character death that has hurt my soul my entire life. J.K. Rowling takes no liberties in this book, and was absolutely determined to make this story even darker and more complex as it goes on. There’s so, so much plot and character development, and the series has officially taken a dark, awful turn. Since this is my 24th reread of the series, I’m no longer surprised when I read it, but I’m still amazed by how incredible and captivating this book is. And how absolutely frustrating it is for Harry, honestly.“The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by an invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing.”As much as I think the characters have had some wonderful character development, I still dislike Ginny, and this book is kind of a big reason why. I’m not going to go fully into it (because I’ve had rants longer than this book on it), but I absolutely, 100% do not agree with people who say she handled Harry’s moods and depression really well in this book. She definitely didn’t, and honestly, neither did Hermione most of the time. That being said, anyone who says Harry is a whiny child in this book can fucking fight me—Ginny and Hermione included. He deserves so much better, but we know that. Also, Luna. That's all.Overall, I loved Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix so, so much, obviously. I loved the humor and the characters and the world that’s developing so nicely. I love these rereads and getting back into the world J.K. Rowling created. I know it’s been fifteen years, but that’s not going to stop me from being absolutely devastated by the major character death in this book, and thinking he also deserves so much better. I can’t wait to get to my reread of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.“Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, “It unscrews the other way.“”↠ Reread #25: February 2-3, 2019.↠ Reread #26: May 27-28, 2019.↠ Reread #27: July 14-15, 2019.↠ Reread #28: January 7-8, 2020.↠ Reread #29: March 24-25, 2020.↠ Reread #30: January 4-5, 2021.↠ Reread #31: August 27-28, 2021.

Despite this being my least favorite I still, of course, loved it but now that I’ve reread it I’ve noticed many different things I’ve missed when I read it for the first time. This book is still amazing and I obviously will give it five stars. Let me start off by saying this book as many can tell, is humongous and requires a lot of commitment. I know that many including myself are intimidated by this book. Can I also just say the writing also very small. Don’t get me wrong I have nothing against long books. In fact, I prefer long books over books with only 100 pages but this book was just unnecessarily too long. I’ve realized that there is a huge amount of pointless information. I know sometimes authors can’t help it but I feel like I’m reading for so long but am not getting anywhere. Now you’re probably asking why I gave it 5 stars if I think some of it was unnecessary. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I know what I’m saying isn’t true but if I gave HP less than 5 stars it would make me (and I’m not saying this about anyone else) feel like I'm not a true fan. I know that’s not true but it’s what I think of myself. I don’t know about anyone else but in bookstores, HP has always been in the children’s section. And I know I know HP is a supposed to be children series but honestly, I do not consider this a children’s series because well 1. I think anyone of any age can read it and 2. I cannot imagine 7 years or whatever reading an 800-page book. I don’t maybe there are children that age that do but personally I can’t imagine it. This book made me realize something I never realized before which is…Harry Potter is the most stuck up person ever and thinks he’s amazing. Honestly, this book made realize why Draco is so mean to him. I’m warning you right now I am going to rant so I’m sorry. 
***** WARNING WARNING WARNING**********SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD**********FOR THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS**********SKIP IF YOU WANT*****
What I hate so much is how Harry gets all the credit! He’s not that amazing and without his friends, he would have done nothing. Do you think in the first book he could have going to through that place where they had to play chess and figure out the potion without his friends? Ron figured the chess game and Hermione found out which potion. The only reason he could defeat Voldemort was because he couldn’t be touched. Also in the second book do you think he would have any idea what was down in the chamber of secrets and what was freezing all the student without Hermione. I guess in the third book he did do a Patronus, I’ll give him that. In the fourth book, he only won because someone was helping him but I’ll give him credit for escaping Voldemort but that was because of his wand and that Voldemort told him to fight him. I get he is powerful but most of it was done with help. Without Ron and Hermione, he couldn’t have done even half the things he did. I can’t even imagine what would have happened. He needs to stop thinking he’s amazing and that he is the only person to have gone through tough times because he isn’t. I actually understand Draco’s POV in the situation now. It pisses me off because Harry is actually so DUMB (I'll get into more detail about that in the 6th book) but manages to become famous and everyone thinks he so powerful. I'd like to see what he'd achieve without his friends.Wow…I needed to get that out
***** SPOILERS FINISHED********** SPOILERS FINISHED********** SPOILERS FINISHED*****
Overall I still think this book was great. Although it wasn’t the best book to try and finish a reading challenge. I’m glad I reread this book because I realized a lot and picked up things I missed before. I still loved this book and thought it was amazing. Also, I understand sometimes books need to be long and cutting out sections is not easy which is why books are sometimes so long.

A couple of reasons actually. Firstly, he is a 15-year-old boy in here. Remember 15-year-old yourself? You were full of angst, too. Secondly, Dumbledore failed Harry, hard. In fact he keep failing him over and over again until the last couple of chapters. The biggest lesson of it all: the adults can be wrong (as an adult it pains me to say it); even the ones you hold in the greatest respect like it is a case with Harry and Dumbledore.I do not think my review would be complete without mentioning the following character:This is how I envision her; the movie version was pretty good too. I am talking about Dolores Umbridge of cause. Compared to Lord Voldemort she is fairly low-level as far as villains go, but she was created in such a way that everybody and their brother love to hate her. So this is the first book of the series which gets less than perfect rating. The main reason is I feel that it could be made shorter - but I'll be damned if I know how. It is still great and everything, but 600+ pages are a little bit too much for a Harry Potter tale, especially the angst-y one.

Its pretty emotional.... often heartbreaking- Harry is put through the wringer in this long door stopper. It could have been shorter - yet it’s so heartfelt - ending on a sad note. I felt proud of Harryin this book —he makes a difference in many characters lives. Really touching! Thank you Lisa....’you’ are definitely my Potter inspiration!!!,2

On this sunny Mother's Day, my middle child suggested that the perfect gift for me would be to finish reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix outside, aloud to her. She wanted us to reach the dramatic conclusion earlier in the day, so the intensity of the ending wouldn't negatively impact her dreams. We've been reading book #5 at night, one chapter at a time, and the mature shift that has taken place in the last few chapters, into violence and loss, has been peppering her sleep lately with images of Bellatrix Lestrange and flashing green lights (hexes!).So, we finished the book today (it was the first time for her, a reread for me), and even though I still consider this book to be overweight by about 100 pages, I enjoyed it even more the second time. I cried a lot more this round, too.Without revealing spoilers, I will describe, simply, that the ending of Phoenix is intense and includes a violent climax between Lord Voldemort and Professor Dumbledore. On page 814, amid raised wands and loud explosions, Voldemort snarls, “There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!Dumbledore responds to this quietly (despite all of the commotion) by telling Voldemort, “You are quite wrong. . . Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness--”I took a pause from reading here and closed the book and asked my daughter, “What do you think he means? What do you think is worse than death?”Without hesitation, my middle child answered, “Sadness. Like the kind of sadness that never stops.”I was taken aback by her answer. As a migraine sufferer, I would have answered “physical pain that won't stop.”But, pain is pain, right? And, if you suffer it long enough, regardless of its source, you may get to the point where you perceive death as a sweet release rather than a “worse case scenario.”When Dumbledore turns this thinking around to Harry and tells him “the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength,” Harry rejects this philosophy and shouts, “I DON'T CARE! I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE--”Wow. How brilliant was J.K. Rowling, in using the span of this big, bold, epic, magical story. . . to explain the loss of innocence, the frequent crippling sense of isolation, and the it-feels-impossible-to-go-on quality of adolescence?My hat's not just off, Ms. Rowling. It's on the floor.

I started reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on 9/15/2018 and finished it on 2/1/2019. (Please ignore the date in this case because it has nothing to do with the book being good or bad. I experience the worst reading slump ever.) This book is a great read! I love learning about Sirius and his family tree. Further along, the story gets a bit boring and long winded. The first time I read this story I loved it but now I feel Harry whines too much and then he constantly landed himself in trouble despite his teammates asking him that they are relying on him or Hermione’s repeated sayings of his friends’ support. I decided to watch the movie again at page 330 and I must say, this movie has no Quidditch game at all. That’s disappointing. I pushed through even though those bans from Umbridge really ruin many excitements for me, like having Harry play the Quidditch. I don’t even get to enjoy how Ginny caught the snitch right under Cho’s nose. I do laugh out loud with Ron’s OWL test in divination though, hilarious!This book is told in the third person point of view following Harry Potter as he spends the summer at his aunt Petunia’s house. He’s feeling bored and frustrated that this past 2 months he hasn’t heard from his friends about what’s going on in the wizarding world, especially news of You-Know-Who after his encounter before the year ended. Then one day while out walking with his cousin Dudley, two dementors came to attack Harry. More people show up on Privet Drive to escort Harry to a secret society in London. Harry is being threatened with losing his wand and expulsion from Hogwarts for breaking the rules of using magic outside of school. Furthermore, Harry just now finds out that over the summer in the Wizarding World, he’s being ridiculed for lying that You Know Who is back. Life at school is no longer the place Harry loves to get away from his uncle and aunt’s house when Professor Dumbledore ignores him and the new Professor puts up new bans almost every other day.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is very well written. I do like how the villain Professor Umbridge is written in this story. She appeared so sweet on the outside with her pink outfits and doilies but wicked evil on the inside with her mean ways punishments. I love Prof McGonagall’s stern attitude with Prof Umbridge. She’s really good with ignoring Umbridge’s throat clearing. I love the humor with past headmasters’ comments. I always love Prof Dumbledore’s uniqueness. The magical world is neat as always, with people moving in photos and picture frames to the magical powers of reading minds. Though it’s lengthy and ongoing at times, it at least offers a bit more of Quidditch than the movie, so I do recommend everyone to read this book!Pro: friendships, mystery, suspense, humor, magical world, fast paced, page turner, easy to read, illustrations, challenges and overcoming obstacles, cleverness, teamwork, anger managementCon: Harry is more whiny than usualI rate it 4.5 stars!***Disclaimer: Reading books I bought for a change..xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com

Instead of a review, I’m just going to share my memories of this book. Back when this came out was the high time of midnight bookstore release parties. Yes, I did go to one and no, I didn’t dress up.It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams’s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had had enough already. My brother brought me to the store and one of his friends was working there; of course being the only ginger on staff he had to dress up like Ron and did not appreciate it. I think he actually hated Harry Potter so that kind of made it worse.Let me preface this next paragraph with the following: I grew up in Las Vegas, so some weird stuff went down that probably wouldn’t have happened anywhere else that night. Not only did the Mayor show up, but “Master Magician” Lance Burton did too. They are local celebs, though why they put in an appearance is beyond me. More on this in a minute.So at about 11:30 everyone starts lining up to get our books. The store decided to release them before midnight and that made it all the more like catnip. I remember seeing some four year olds plopped down in an aisle with their copies, pretending to read them…and I thought, who would stop me if I just took it from the kid and ran out? I didn’t though, obviously, but Potter fever makes you think strange thoughts, especially while waiting in line for a highly anticipated book.Both the Mayor and the “Master Magician” were signing copies of the book. I don’t understand this at all, and still think that somewhere on ebay somebody must have bid on an “autographed copy” and gotten one signed by one of these men. While that’s technically true, can you just imagine the disappointment??When I did finally have it in my hands… oh, that beautiful gloriously blue cover. You knew from Mary GrandPré’s artwork that something major was going to go down, and it did. I started reading it with a booklight on the drive home but was told that the light was distracting my brother’s driving. Buzzkill. Didn’t he know how important this was?!?!?!?!Arriving home, I went straight to bed and stayed up all night reading. At some point, I think at about 2am, my mom came into my room. She took the book from me, and flipped towards the end, read about Sirius’s death, then gave it back to me without a word. (She had read the first 4 to her third grade class and still chokes up at the mention of “the boy who lived”). She never actually read the fifth book or the rest, but always insisted I tell her everything that happened once I finished them.I finished it later that day. I didn't care too much that Sirius died, but I do remember being slightly miffed that Rowling never cleared up more about that Veil in the Department of Mysteries. That was such a cruel tease, Jo.

IT TOOK ME OVER A YEAR BUT IM FINALLY DONE WITH THIS MONSTER OF A BOOK AND IM SO GLAD ITS OVER I honestly didn’t think I’d ever finish this, it was such a ridiculously long story that was badly written, a super stretched plot (it REALLY didn’t need to be this long) and 99% of the characters I couldn’t stand since they either exaggerated every scene they were in or were just whining the whole way through.I started off by reading the physical book which was such a bad choice as I had the first edition hardback which is so big and heavy I couldn’t bring it with me anywhere. Also reading Harry Potter is often a snooze and so at nearly halfway through - where I put the book down for months with no intention to continue - I realised it was either audiobook or nothing. So for the rest of the story I had to listen to hours and hours of a plot with no actual development to end with about 50 pages of the only bit of action in the book?None of the characters were actually doing anything interesting throughout, so many unnecessary scenes! Why was there a Quidditch scene in there, it had nothing to do with the story! Do we really need to know what’s on every floor in St Mungo’s? There were so many useless scenes with Cho Chang that weren’t needed because it was clear the two were going nowhere. And to at least help redeem that, why didn’t Rowling at least make her likeable?? Her stupid unrealistic childish jealously nearly made me want to rip my hair out.I HATE HARRY. SO MUCH.Firstly, he couldn’t be any more cliché: dead parents, clever and dumb sidekicks, an evil master trying to kill him because he’s ‘the chosen one’ etc. (and before you fight me no, hp is not the starting point of novels with these clichés, Rowling took this idea from other books so shut up) and secondly, I read the previous books in this series, actually liking some, and I really can’t remember Harry being this much of a whiny and ridiculous character. He complained about EVERYTHING and he’s one of the dumbest characters I’ve ever read about, always making the wrong choices and he gets angry at every single person who tries to talk to him with a single bit of logic??? He’s 16, not 5! I couldn’t bring myself to like him one bit.The whole Umbridge thing is sooo over the top! Hogwarts would never allow someone like her in charge because of how extreme she is and the terrible portrayal of a ‘bad guy’ by Rowling. She is carving into Harry’s skin as punishment and Dumbledore somehow knows nothing about it? And if he does, he lets it happen in his school? Nah, I don’t buy it.The writing style is incredibly repetitive and boring (did I mention this yet?) with every character speaking in exactly the same way (only Hagrid stands out) and with Rowling feeling the need to add ‘said’ after nearly every line spoken. Some variation in words or sentence structure please???I’m still going to carry on with the series because although this one was a massive disappointment and the writing difficult to bear, I enjoyed POA and GOF enough to want to find out the differences between the film ending and the book ending at the very end. Those books are also fairly big and I’m hoping they’re not as painful to read as this one.THIS IS THE MOST OVERHYPED SERIES OF ALL TIME. If you want to read a good fantasy series, anything by Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss or J.R.R.Tolkien will be a much better example of good written fantasy novels with better developed characters and a most interesting plot. Have a good day.1.5 stars out of five. And I’m really not sorry.

J K Rowling's prose has transformed from being geared toward kids to teenagers, mirroring Harry's own development. In books 1-4, the language is easy enough that despite the length even middle grade kids should be able to read it. Book 5 is more tedious. The themes are darker and tougher to digest. Additionally the students are interested in dating, making the content slightly inappropriate for younger readers. Prose aside, we see new characters and many developments in the plot lines. We witness how powerful Dumbledore's abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort's death eaters and Dumbledore's army. The end makes it challenging for me to finish the entire book even after all these times because I know what is coming. Looking forward to books 6 and 7 which I enjoy much more than this one.

#mystrangereading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J. K. Rowling ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️""Youth can not know how age thinks and feels, but old men are guilty if they forget what it is to be young.""I absolutely love how Dumbledore gets a talk with Harry at the conclusion of each book and summarizes the main conflict and theme of the novel. The fifth installment of this series is so masterful. We finally get a broader picture of the wizarding community and realize that not everyone is so quick to believe that Voldemort is back. We see the aftermath of Cedric's death and Voldemort's rise and watch as Harry grows more and more angry at everyone's denial and disbelief. Things that make this book so incredible: 🧙🏻‍♀️ The Order of the Phoenix. Each member is so unique and special. I love that they all bring something different to the table and are all so bad-ass. 🧙🏻‍♀️Kreacher. He is horrible and hilarious. I love that a house elf gets an important storyline and is so subtlely apart of the overall 'big bad' in the story. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Dolores Umbridge. She is literally the worst. She almost makes you forget how much we hate Voldemort which I think is the brilliance of her character. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Sirius Black. 😭😭😭 He loves Harry so much. 🧙🏻‍♀️Ron and Hermoine. They are really the best representation of friends. They will call Harry on his crap but always back him up when it matters. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Luna and Nevil. I love them. I love how unassuming both of them are and yet how quickly they become apart of the gang and are so important to the resolution of the story. 🧙🏻‍♀️ Dumbledore's army. Hermoine was a rebel!! It makes my heart so happy. The kids sticking it to the Ministry by naming themselves the very thing the Ministry was afraid of. GENIUS. This book was amazing and this re-read was such a powerful reminder of how Rowling never writes anything by accident. Every little thing has a purpose and it's beautiful.

How Sweet!Also missing: long explanations and carefully constructed dream-plots and traps that make complete sense unlike that mess we saw in the movie that just kinda slaps us in a direction and lets us be surprised... Hey! Look where we are, and we're fighting! Sheesh.All I can say is, ""Bravo, Volemort! Yours was actually a pretty good plan even if you're missing a certain piece of intelligence.""All told, I can honestly say that I liked this one better than all the rest up to this point. There's not so much flash and dash as all the rest, except with the blowout battle with the Deatheaters and Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end, but there is way more than enough conflict and rising tension for three lesser books. We all know this is a dark story with Dolores. What fantastic fun!

Fuck you. — Molly being unable to get rid of the boggart in Grimmauld Place because she is overtaken by emotion of seeing all of her loved ones dead… and then Lupin having to get rid of it after seeing Harry’s dead body on the floor - oh my lawd - and then Sirius having seen Harry’s dead body as well probably remembering the time he found James and Lily dead - WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? — this year being the first year Harry wouldn’t be able to travel the Hogwarts Express with Ron since he and Hermione had to go to the Prefect’s carriage and then patrol the corridors, I cry — Dean telling the others that his parents are unaware of the deaths happening at Hogwarts because he doesn’t inform them. - ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? DUMBLEDORE WHAT ARE YOU DOING??? YOU NEED TO INFORM THE FRIGGIN PARENTS? LIKE FOR REAL, ONE OF THESE DAYS I AM GETTING YOU OUT OF YOUR TOMB, OLD MAN, JUST TO SUE YOU! — Harry not seeking help after his first detention with Dolores is just such a Harry-thing to do, my boy has suffered so much abuse, he thinks he will “lose” if he lets other people see his pain (and not wanting to put his friends through the horror of seeing his wounds), ugh, I cry, — Pansy harassing the only Black girl in the series (Angelina Johnson) about her hairstyle (“Why would anyone want to look like they’ve got worms coming out of their head?”) is too fucking much, her ass has been cancelled a long time ago, but… no, just no!— Percy’s “congratulating” letter to Ron (about becoming prefect and not going down the “Fred and George route”) was too fucking much; the audacity that he criticised his fucking parents, boyy, you got a big storm coming — Sirius accusing (and thus manipulating) Harry by saying “You’re less like your father than I thought” was such a fucking low-point for me, it’s the worst thing he’s ever said and Harry deserves so much better; he was reaching out to Sirius as his last hope and he came out of the conversation feeling more shitty than ever because Sirius made him feel worthless, well done, mate… I’m just picturing James in heaven being super mega disappointed with Sirius in this moment… how dare he… I can’t even… Fuck you, Sirius! — Umbridge banning Harry, F & G from playing Quidditch was the fucking worst — when the Weasleys and Harry arrived at Grimmauld Place (after Arthur was attacked) and they all wanted to see their father immediately and Sirius said: “There are things worth dying for.” And Fred fucking replied: “Easy for you to say, stuck here. I don’t see you risking your neck.” It was just a little too fucking much for my heart, ugh — Molly crying because PERCY SENT BACK his CHRISTMAS JUMPER… how fucking dare he — Harry getting into Snape’s memory by using the Pensieve after Snape left his office.. m’boy, how stupid are you tho??? That whole situation when Snape found him there was just too fucking tense, I cannot deal ! — Umbridge revealing she sent the Dementors after Harry in Little Whinging … so fucking crazy, this hoe! — “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole, you had suffered.” - IS DUMBY FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? Harry was severely abused (mentally, verbally and physically) for 10 fucking years and Dumby had the audacity to tell him that this was exactly what he had planned? Kill him with fire.REVIEW (2015): What can I say? This is my all time favorite Harry Potter book! (Probably my all time favorite book-book that isn't a classic even though it kinda is, right?)And funnily enough Order has always been my favorite, ever since I discovered as a 11 year old that my (German) copy of it had over 1000 pages (1024 pages to be exact :D) and I felt sooooooo accomplished by reading a book with over 1000 pages and ""getting"" it and loving it.The reason why Order is so precious to me is because in this one I got the best examination of Hogwarts as a school and how deep the bond between students, students and teachers and their sense of belonging to the Wizarding Community is. In my opinion the real villain in this wasn't Lord Voldermort but Dolores Umbridge. I loved that she was a threat INSIDE OF HOGWARTS and therefore made the students feel afraid and uncomfortable within bounds that used to be the most safest and comforting. I loved how the whole school united to take her down (except for some Slytherins... but oh well JKR really needed to keep that stereotype right? smh). I laughed tears when we got to the scene in which Umbridge is punishing Harry constantly because he did the Quibbler interview about how the Dark Lord is returning and Fudge is telling lies. And all the other teachers want to show Harry their support and so Madame Sprout awards Gryffindor 20 points because HARRY PASSED HER A FUCKING WATERING CAN or Flitwick secretly slips him sweets after his lessons and Trelawney ""sees in the future"" that Harry would live ""to ripe old age and become Minister for Magic"". I couldn't man, it was sooooo fucking perfect. It made me furiously happy.I also really loved the way Luna was introduced and what she brought to the story. Because she is kind of an outcast and a nutter but at the same time she is portrayed in such a way that you as a reader really get to see how clever and right she is about things. And her loyalty to Harry gets me every time. That she actually flew with the crew to the Ministry of Magic is just a crazy act of bravery (because she literally only got to know Harry & Co. half a year ago)... this girl, man, I love her so much.A lot of people think that Order is the worst in the series because ""Harry is so moody in this one"". To people who firmly believe that all I can say is: FUCK YOU. Well that is a little harsh but I have so much compassion when it comes to Harry. I feel so much protectiveness and I hate it when people give him shit. Harry fucking Potter was abused since he was a toddler in the most nastiest way by his uncle, aunt and cousin and he fucking remained a good person and didn't turn bitter or all psycho. He is the most humble character that I know and honestly sooo pure and innocent. He is used as a chess piece by Dumbledore but is still willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good and he is just my little baby and if you're coming for him I WILL FIGHT YOU. Of course he is fucking moody in Order. First and foremost HE IS A FRIGGIN TEENAGER and teenagers ARE MOODY (get over it) and he feels fucking left out because Dumbledore is purposefully leaving him in the dark and he is just confused as fuck. He feels estranged from his friends (and all the other students from Hogwarts) because the fucking News are reporting about him and what a lying little shit he is DAILY. How do you deal with that? Then we have the little shit Umbridge who is tormenting him more than any other student and if I were Harry I would be just as fucking moody as him. He has every right to be. The whole Sirius situation is also quite tragic. Sirius isn't my favorite character because he is so manipulative and basically causing a deeper drift between Harry and his friends. But on the other hand I understand Sirius' behaviour to the fullest because for him Harry equals James (his best friend he lost in a fucking tragic way; probs still blaming himself for his death) and on top of that he was held captive in Azkaban for 13 friggin' years (thanks for nothing, Dumbledore, you little shit) and his mind was just bound to be fucked because of this. So the whole Sirius situation is rather complex and I feel compassion for him - especially since Dumbledore (the little shit) forced him to be bound to his old childhood home - a place that only gives him anxiety and which is linked to his darkest memories (I mean can you imagine being exposed to a screaming portrait of the mother who hated you with all her heart). So overall, Order had just the perfect mix of funny, tragic, beautiful, witty, depressing and real moments of any of the Harry Potter books and it will forever stay in my heart.Things I forgot to mention but that are golden in this are RON AND HERMIONE BECOMING FUCKING PREFECTS, RON BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE QUIDDITCH TEAM (so proud of him and the whole Weasley is our King-subplot is all I needed in my life), Harry's disastrous date with Cho Chang in Hogsmeadeeee, Dumbledore's freaking Army. I can't deal. SOO MUCH WAS IN HERE AND I COULD CRY!!

“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.” The last two chapters of this book are heart-wrenching. This book may not be perfect, but it was inching its way toward that finish line. I enjoy comedic, childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans, but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper), it gets even better. We get a return of favorite characters, but as with the other books, we also get new ones. While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about, here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up: Dolores Umbridge (shudder) and Bellatrix (who I can't stand.)Harry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings. Happily this didn't bother me because - let's face it - these are dark times in the young wizard's life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic. Plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends, Dumbledore, and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer. Then you have the Voldemort strange triangle in his head, probably fueling that anger. I noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility, left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens.Hermione and Ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend, becoming of all things, perfects in the school. It was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it. Loony Luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange, although the convenience of her character's connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well. There's Fred and George, who I always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior, especially when showing up a certain new villain.Where this book shines character-wise is Neville, who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter. There's a teary situation in the hospital, and how he stands by Harry (stuffed nose and all) in a fight later was heart-winning. Dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome, badass reputation in the wizarding world, and I couldn't be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle.“You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...” Since Snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally, it was a further delight that Harry had to learn Occlumency from the professor. The scenes were intense and, although a small subplot, mesmerized me. They showed a glimpse into the life of Harry's parents before he put them on a pedestal.Can we all agree that McGonagall is even more likable after this book? I didn't care about her the first few, but she keeps growing on me. Here she's amazing. Sirius...ah, Sirius. This book shows even further that he is dependent upon Harry because he misses James so much and sees the father in the son. There was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from Harry a bit because he's disappointed. He spends much of the book frustrated and lonely, which was realistic and deep but depressing. I love their relationship, both without families but connecting to each other due to that.Let's wave aside the villain of Voldemort for this book, shall we? He's there, he's bad, but he's not that frequent and he isn't the one who really irritated readers in this one. Those badges go to the annoying Umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil Bellatrix. Umbridge is around for the majority of book, raising shivers of annoyance. Besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her, there's the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor Harry. It certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before.I hate to see Harry tricked at the end, but you can't keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time. The book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes, but they were still imaginative and adventurous. It's a large book, 870 pages, and if you stand back and examine it, not a lot of action actually happens. Still, it's so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away. There's a heartbreaking, soul-slapping death that I don't think I'll get over. I knew it was coming, but couldn't remember the order from the movies when it would show up. Sadness! It was sudden and shocking and just awful. Harry's emotion afterwards was realistic and well done.J.K. Rowling continues this series with talent, and the books really do keep getting better and better. A timeless series that should continue to bewitch future generations.

It’s settled. The fifth Harry Potter book has worked a miracle. I actually like the Harry Potter series. You hear that?

The fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, on the other hand, is a great fantasy novel.The atmosphere is finally a lot darker, the story is a lot more coherent, and several new characters, organisations, places and scenes add a lot of complexity.One of the most important aspects is the expansion of Severus Snape’s character. One particular flashback made me understand all his actions (though not quite like him, at least not yet) and hate Harry’s sorry excuse for a father more than any literary character ever.The wildly interesting Order of the Phoenix is (obviously) introduced, several of Sirius’ ancestors show up in various forms (including the absodamnlutely amazing Phineas Nigellus Black), Dumbledore is truly shining in this instalment and the final scenes in the Department of Mysteries top the whole thing off greatly.All in all, the second half of the series has placed itself on a much higher level than the first, and I am fully immersed in it for the first time.

The Order of the Phoenix will have a large role to play in these last few books and we start to see a bit more humanity in some characters who have up to now been nearly demi-gods. I feel like there are a few key themes throughout the HP universe in terms of critical values which I share with the author. One of the ones dealt with in Order of the Phoenix continues to be the mechanics of racism (in this case the (hypocritical) hate of Muggles by Voldemort & Co. The way that Rowling builds this up is a great study in terms of how both Jews in Europe and blacks in the US have been vilified and how even the rare Jew or black can adopt the oppressive mindset due to their own self-hate and just ignore the contradictions. Similarly, the treatment of house-elves which Hermione has so persistently fought for (and for which Ron has consistently teased her becomes a key element to the tragic climax of this particular novel. On to the Half-Blood Prince...

The Harry Potter experience has little time for rest and relaxation, with this fifth book in the series. Things take a significant turn towards the dark and eerie, yet the story remains captivating as magic politics takes centre stage. What began with a boy wizard has become a fight for survival with the evil Voldemort appearing in strange and mysterious ways throughout the piece, even as many deny his presence. The reader will have to pay close attention to connect with all the plotlines that J.K. Rowling offers, though the dedication does not go unrewarded. Rowling surely has outdone herself here as readers push into what might be called the ‘maturation’ of the series, no longer short books that rely solely on humour. Perfect for those who want something more adventurous and without the guarantee of a happy ending!Harry has again been forced into a state of boredom all summer long. Still stuck living with the Dursleys, Harry must bide his time and hope the days pass quickly before it’s time to return to Hogwarts. While out one evening, Harry and his cousin, Dudley, are set upon by Dementors. Harry does the only thing he can think to do and accesses his magical capabilities, in direct violation of Ministry of Magic regulations. Harry is forced to attend a disciplinary hearing when his actions are made known, one that could cost him a spot at Hogwarts during his important Fifth Year!After an intense process, Harry is exonerated, but not before he learns of a secret society, the Order of the Phoenix. Created by his headmaster, Dumbledore, the Order is currently housed in the home of Sirius Black, who remains wanted by the Ministry. Harry’s eyes are opened to the inner workings of wizardry and the politics that keeps the Ministry of Magic at arm’s length.Harry’s return to Hogwarts brings a great deal of change. Not only is it Fifth Year, but the OWL exams await students, a set of tests that help streamline further educational and career aspirations. Plus, a new professor has joined the faculty, Delores Umbridge, who has strong ties to the Ministry. While Ron and Hermione are eager to see what the year brings, an ominous cloud hangs over Harry, not to mention the constant ache of his forehead scar.While Harry tells anyone who will listen that he had a run-in with Voldemort, many follow the Ministry line and deny that it happened, choosing to consider that Harry and Dumbledore are mad and seeking to steal the limelight. Leading the denials is Delores Umbridge, who does all in her power to break Harry down in secretive and destructive ways. The reader discovers the pains Harry must endure at the hands of Umbridge, who appears to be power hungry herself.As the Ministry of Magic seeks to put Hogwarts in its place, they nominate Professor Umbridge as High Inquisitor, allowing her to vet and remove any on the teaching faculty deemed out of line. Umbridge is also given the iron fist to bring the students in line, putting Harry in her crosshairs from Day One. Harry and Umbridge clash repeatedly, which eventually leads to a monumental decision that could ruin Fifth Year. Through a series of secret communications, Harry tries to explain himself to Sirius, who offers support but cannot come to the aid of his godson as effectively as he would like. Harry does the only thing he can do, rallying students who feel the squeeze of the High Inquisitor. The creation of Dumbledore’s Army is a protest movement that will pit Harry against the Ministry in a standoff like no other. Things go so far that one senior member of Hogwarts will have to pay the price. As the OWLs approach, Harry must juggle his studies, his ongoing romantic interest in one of his fellow students, and a series of dark dreams that he cannot fully comprehend. He receives help from a completely unexpected source to help block his mind from the powers that Voldemort appears to be trying to push. The scar aches repeatedly, which can only mean that evil awaits, though no one is entirely sure when or how!As Umbridge takes further control at Hogwarts, it is an epic battle over the future of the institution, as well as a clash of good versus evil. Harry and Voldemort are destined to collide, which could end badly for everyone. With Hogwarts in shambles, Harry can only hope that he will be able to wrest control back to the good side, or face likely expulsion for good. Then again, if he’s dead, school won’t matter at all!J.K. Rowling offers her readers, young and old alike, a story full of excitement and thrills on every page. As usual, there are nuances that appeal to various reading levels, making the story highly intriguing.Harry Potter retains the protagonist role, always maturing and finding new way to show this to the attentive reader. There are moments of significant backstory to offer, should the reader be paying close attention between the action-filled narrative in the present. Rowling again addresses the scar and its symbolism, providing more for the reader who has surely come with more questions. The reader gets another look at the personal side of Harry’s life, talking about his romantic interests as a more regular concern. Balancing that with an important school year provides needed depth for Harry’s character. With added struggles related to Voldemort, Harry proves to be one character who refuses to turn stagnant. The reader also sees the morose side of Harry Potter, especially in the final section of the novel.Rowling continues providing strong supporting characters for her readers, both individuals present throughout the entire series and those whose one-off status was specifically designed for this novel. The ever-evolving aspect of the story permits Rowling to add new perspectives to Hogwarts and focus on an ever-growing group of humans and creatures alike. There is some development in a handful of the characters, which helps contrast alongside the advancements that Harry makes and permits readers to see growth in their favourites.This was another of the ‘truly complex novels’, books that exceed the basics of what I would expect Neo might want to handle. However, he has been devouring them with relative ease. This was the longer of all the books, but it needed every pages to hash out some of the more complicated plot lines that could not have effectively been divided over a few novels. I can only hope that this does/did not scare some readers away, as there is such an attachment to a number of the characters that can develop for the dedicated and attentive reader.The book uses a strong narrative to push it along and leaves the reader wanting more with every chapter. Much is revealed in relation of the Ministry of Magic and some of its more nefarious plans, as well as the darker side of the Potter-Voldemort clashes. Both of these appear to be essential to understanding the larger story arc that Rowling injects into the narrative. I can see many of the truths unveiled in this book are to be important parts as the series progresses, so I am trying to stay alert. Longer chapters help build a deeper story and entertaining the eager reader. I cannot wait to see what awaits me in the final few novels, as Harry surely is not done learning about himself, his family, and his role in the larger Hogwarts/Ministry struggles.Kudos, Madam Rowling, another stellar piece of writing. I cannot wait to see what else you have for your reading fans.Love/hate the review?

Continuing my reread with the illustrated editions! Gotta get through this one so that my daughter can start it next. <3*********************""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.""What can I say that hasn't been said before about this series? What words can do this book justice? I've felt at a loss on how to explain my feelings for these books as I've read them. I didn't experience them as a child and therefore my experience is clearly different than most others on here, but in some ways I think it's just as magical to read these for the first time as an adult as it was for everyone who devoured these as they were published in their childhood. I have kids, so I was constantly wondering how my 5 year old will accept these books when she's a bit older and tried to view the story through her eyes. The holidays are always a busy, stressful time for us. All of our family is a hefty distance to travel to and, on top of that, we're moving into our new place this month. All I could think about was how desperately I wanted to escape all of my adult responsibilities for just a bit each day, and this was the perfect book to do so with. No matter your age, the magical world of Hogwarts is truly spectacular; the characters are such that they stay with you even after the final page is turned and the writing takes you back to a place you weren't sure existed for us old farts anymore. If you have been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years like I have, I highly encourage you pick these books up and get swept away like I did. Time is a precious commodity these days, and you couldn't spend it in a better way than with these precious kiddos.

He means well, I know he does, it's just that he's such a frustratingly well-meaning bumbling idiot.
“You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.”
Aaaaaaaand one final note.
“Ginny!” said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. “Haven’t I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain?""
No particular reason I included that, except for the fact that it reminded me of my ex-boyfriend :3

I didn’t like how the mystery was conveniently solved, the monologue of explanation from the villain at the end, and how Hermione was literally petrified throughout most of the book just so that she wouldn’t have figured everything out right away. But I’m glad to finally be done with this book so that, just like Dobby, I am free.

I have picked a ton of pictures from the book but believe me, there are plenty more beautiful ones in the book. Plus, if your a Harry Potter fan you will be getting the book anyway if you haven't already!So poor Harry is stuck back with the Dursley's on Privet Drive. And even though Harry is a relative, they still treat him like poo because he's magical. Ewwwwww. Harry is depressed because he has be cut off from talking to his friends or getting any kind of correspondence. Even poor Hedwig has been locked in her cage and hasn't been able to fly around. CRUEL! But Harry can't use magic inside the muggle world. Then Harry meets Doby - the little house-elf that is waiting for him in his room. It turns out that Doby has been intercepting his correspondence because he fears for Harry's life and doesn't want him to return to Hogwarts. So Doby causes some problems at the house that get Harry in trouble. I had to add this cute little picture of Doby running off, look at his little butt. lol ↓Then one night, Ron, George and Fred pull up outside Harry's window in their dads flying car to save Harry. It's pretty funny how they get it all going but that is okay as long as Harry gets away from his evil relatives. Of course, Mrs. Weasley is not pleased when they get back home. The sneaking out part didn't work very well, but she welcomed Harry with open arms and he stayed with them until it was time for them all to go back to school. I love that picture of the Weasley house =) Life at The Burrow was as different as possible from life in Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantlepiece and it shouted, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like himPoor sweet Harry and I would love to live with the Weasleys' for a bit =) Look at cute, fat little Scabbers ↓The kids are going to meet Hermione to get some shopping done. But ole Harry takes a wrong turn down the chimney hole and ends up in some creepy shop. He hides and gets to hear some things Malfoy and his father are talking about.Finally Harry makes it out of the store and Hagrid finds him and gets him to the right place with his friends. Then Ron and Harry are blocked from getting on the train soooooo back to stealing the flying car. AND of course they get into trouble when they get to Hogwarts but it wasn't anything too bad. Snape looked as though Christmas had been cancelled. He cleared his throat and said. 'Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree . . . surely acts of this nature . . . 'It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys' punishments, Severus,' said Dumbledore calmly. 'They are in her house and are therefore her responsibility.' He turned to Professor McGonagall. 'I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I've got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample.'There is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor named Gideroy Lockhart. He's a bit off but still . . . Anyway things are not right at Hogwarts. (are they ever?) And Harry and the gang must figure out what's going on. Poor ole Hagrid gets sent off to Azkaban for something he didn't do! Malfoy is a jerk, as if we didn't know that. lol Harry and Ron go out in the woods to meet Aragog the spider that is friends of Hagrid to find out some truth behind some stuff. Comes to find out there is this diary of a person named Tom Riddle. I'm not telling you who this person really is but they are the one causing all kinds of trouble for a lot of people. In the end Harry has to end up fighting a Basilisk to set things right. He has the help of the sorting hat for reasons, Dumbledore's Phoenix and a sword. Oh happy day! There is loads more to the book then the things I have described but you can just read it and if you haven't, why haven't you? Harry Potter rocks and always will. There is another happy ending for sweet Doby! ♥Harry gives Dobby his stinky sock so this releases Doby. He now has his freedom from the evil Lucius Malfoy! Woot! 'Come, Dobby, I said, Come!'But Dobby didn't move. He was holding up Harry's disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 'Master has given Dobby a sock,' said the elf in wonderment. 'Master gave it to Dobby.''What's that?' spat Mr. Malfoy. 'What did you say?''Dobby has got a sock,' said Dobby in disbelief. 'Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby-Dobby is free.'Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged for Harry. 'You've lost me my servant, boy!'But Dobby shouted, 'You shall not harm Harry Potter!'There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backwards. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumbled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long threatening finger. 'You shall go now,' he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. 'You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.'Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him ad hurried out of sight.This book is wonderful, it always has been and always will, and the graphics in this book make it even better. ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List

I can’t believe that I forgot so many things. Like for instance the fact that Dumbledore actually was a Transfiguration teacher before he became headmaster. Kinda suitable that this is McGonagall’s role now. ;-) 1.) ”Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby … Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew…”Aww Dobby! It was so good to see him again! He’s really one of the best HP characters ever and this even though he made it kind of tough to like him. *lol* Well, at least at the beginning. Poor Harry! XD2.) ”Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night!” shouted Mrs Weasley. “What have you got to say about that, eh?”“Did you really?” said Mr Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? I-I mean,” he faltered, as sparks flew from Mrs Weasley’s eyes, “that-that was very wrong, boys – very wrong indeed …”I’ll always love how Mr Weasley is more interested in finding out if the car flew well than in his kids actually flying the car! *lol* Also Molly Weasley giving him hell for not reacting the way a responsible parent is supposed to is just epic! Haha! Those two. You can see they have a great marriage! ;-P3.) ”Mr Weasley had a cut lip and Mr Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools.”How could I forget that Mr Weasley threw himself at Malfoy? One of the best things in this book ever! Not that I support violence (I’m a pacifist) but even I can’t help appreciating that Lucius Malfoy for once, actually had his ass handed to him. XD 4.) ”That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying gleefully to Mrs Norris. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet.”How come I never noticed this before?! The foreboding!!! OMG! Like damn, there are so many things that are mentioned only briefly and rather casually and then when you continue to read the series they reappear with a vengeance! O_o With every book I read I’m more and more awed by J.K Rowling’s genius! 5.) ”Homework: compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!”Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself! I swear he must have been the worst DADA teacher they ever had. And they had many over the years which even Dumbledore can’t deny. Loved that bit at the ending when he said he’d have to write an ad because they “seem to run through them”. *lol*6.) ”You are Muggle-born?”“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.”There definitely was a history lesson hidden in there. It’s fascinating how Riddle of all people could be a half-blood and then go against Muggle born wizards! I’m sure J.K. Rowling thought about World War II when she wrote this, because all the pure-blood and half-blood etc. stuff reminds me of a very dark chapter in German history… >_<7.) ”But why’s she got to go to the library?”“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”Did anyone notice how well Ron knows Hermione? And how often he defended her in this book? I mean he actually would have fought Malfoy with his bare hands if Harry and Dean would have allowed it! It’s so obvious that Ron cares about her deeply! To vomit snails without complaining about it should count as the ultimate indication of eternal love and affection! *LOL*8.) ”Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye.McGonagall losing it was another great moment in this book! When you least expect it she always shows some kindness and heart and to be honest this never ceases to amaze me! XD She’s a great teacher and I’m not surprised that she always takes over when Dumbledore isn’t around. 9.) ”You’re in luck,” said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. And what’s inside it. Let’s go.”I just love Harry, okay?! *lol* For such a young kid he certainly has a lot of guts and courage! The way he dealt with Lockhart? I think not even an adult wizard could have done it any better. XD The sheer audacity to demand aid from him like that. YES! Haha! <310.) (view spoiler)[”Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.”I CAN’T BELIEVE ROWLING ALREADY MENTIONED THIS IN BOOK TWO!!! I mean Harry quite literally said that Voldemort put a bit of himself in him!!! A part of his soul!!! It’s so obvious that Harry is a Horcrux!!! GAH!!! It’s all there and I never saw it!!! That’s just brilliant! Dumbledore must have known all along! I really need to reread the entire series because I can’t remember if he already knew it right from the beginning or if it was just a theory at first.  (hide spoiler)]I can’t wait to read “The Prisoner of Azkaban”! I’m afraid it might have to wait until next year though! So many books, so little time! ;-) ______________________________As always I loved this! <3And boy there were so many hints! The foreboding is real in this one! *lol*Also I kinda like that every book ends with the school year and that there’s no cliff-hanger! I never thought about this but HP is so successful and this even though there are never cliff-hangers. XD (Well, at least not in the strict sense...)Must be magic! ;-P______________________________I’m already reading 6 books,
BUT
this is Harry Potterand it’s autumn close to Halloweenand I just need another comfort read? *lol* Plus 2 of my six books will be finished soon so this means that I’ll be down to 5 again which is my usual amount. XDLook at me being all reasonable and responsible. Haha! ;-PBut honestly, do I even need a reason to read Harry Potter? No, HP can be read anytime! =))

It is once again exciting to wander across the Hogwarts halls, observing the mysterious facts that involve the protagonists, just like we were there too. This is Rowling's rare gift: making sure that we see through the eyes of Harry, Ron and Hermione.The summer holidays have passed, and the new school year is about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's power is still immature, but Dumbledore's teaching is adamant:«It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities» This time, our young wizards are struggling with the new professor of defense against the dark arts, the dork and vein Gilderoy Lockhart, called to replace Professor Quirrell (died in the previous adventure). However, the joyful atmosphere is soon ruined: strange events begin to happen...Far be it from me to spoiler something of this mystery-fantasy. J.K. Rowling gives us another masterpiece to live, rather than to read. Actually, I do not know if my daughter was more pleased than me to hear this novel, or if I was happier than her to read it and literally interpret it (I even modulated the voices of the different characters). Any excuse to read Harry Potter.Vote: 9Lettura serale per mia figlia (e seconda rilettura per me). E' ancora una volta emozionante vagare per le sale di Hogwarts e osservare i fatti misteriosi che coinvolgono i protagonisti, proprio come se fossimo lì anche noi. Questo è il raro dono della Rowling. Fare in modo che vediamo con gli occhi di Harry, Ron ed Hermione.Trascorse le vacanze estive, alla scuola di magia e stregoneria di Hogwarts sta per iniziare il nuovo anno. Il potere di Harry è ancora immaturo, ma l'insegnamento di Silente è categorico:«Sono le scelte che facciamo, Harry, che dimostrano quel che siamo veramente, molto più delle nostre capacità» Stavolta, i nostri giovani maghi sono alle prese con il nuovo insegnante di difesa dalle arti oscure, il Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, tanto imbranato quanto vanitoso, chiamato a sostituire il Professor Quirrell, deceduto nella precedente avventura. L'atmosfera gioiosa è presto rovinata, però: strani eventi cominciano ad accadere, associati ad una certa camera dei segreti...Lungi da me spoilerare qualcosa di questo fantasy del mistero. J.K. Rowling ci regala un'altro capolavoro da vivere, più che da leggere. A conti fatti, non so se sia stata più contenta mia figlia di sentirselo raccontare, o se sia stato più contento io di leggerlo e letteralmente interpretarlo (ho perfino modulato le voci dei diversi personaggi). La scusa è buona, in ogni caso.Voto: 9

So yeah, firstly, loved this book and looking forward to the next one. And secondly, now more of the art on the HP mug I got from OwlCrate a few months ago makes more sense and I totally love it more now, so there's that. Winning all around.

Welcome to my re-read of the magical series “Harry Potter”. 🤓⚡️My journey this time around is a hybrid of reading the books, listening to a fun (adult) podcast and watching the movies. ❤️📚🎧🎬 ⚠️Spoiler Warning: stop reading now, if you’re unfamiliar with the world of Hogwarts.⚠️Personal Opinion Note: I’m terribly sad for you, if you’ve never read the books (or at least watched the movies). 😉📚🎧🎬I’ll be updating this review as I progress through the series, so, be prepared for a long review. 🤗📚Chapter 1: The Worst BirthdaysThe Dursley’s have not changed. They’re still terrible muggles. Harry has not heard from anyone all summer. Uncle Vernon’s boss is coming to dinner and Harry’s been told to stay upstairs and not make a sound.📚Chapter 2: Dobby’s WarningDobby the house elf really makes a bad first impression. Dobby had been taking all of Harry’s letters all summer, in hopes that Harry wouldn’t want to go back to school. Dobby does a spell and Harry gets the blame, soon after a letter arrives from the ministry of magic giving Harry a warning. Uncle Vernon puts bars on his window and says he can’t go back to Hogwarts.📚Chapter 3: The BurrowThe Weasley’s really are the best! Them showing up in a flying car to rescue Harry is the best scene ever. Harry tells them about Dobby. Fred and George tell him house elves usually belong to rich wizard families. Harry believes Malfoy sent him. Ron is embarrassed by his home, but Harry thinks it’s brilliant.📚Chapter 4: At Flourish and BlottsI love that Hagrid breaks up a fight between two grown wizards! Harry and the Weasley’s head to Diagon Alley to gather school supplies. Gilderoy Lockhart is signing books and announces that he’ll be the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Mr. Weasley gets into a rumble with Mr. Malfoy.📚Chapter 5: The Whomping WillowThat’s one mean tree!! Harry and Ron are unable to get through platform 9 3/4. So, they fly the car, along the train, to Hogwarts. But the crash the car into a very old and angry tree when they arrive. Ron breaks his wand. 🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 1-5***Warning: podcast has adult content***Ummm… did you read that warning? If you’re easily offended by things like: swears, wanking jokes, milf’s, etc. etc. do not listen to this podcast. To all my fellow heathens out there, this is not only entertaining- but also very spot on!📚Chapter 6: Gilderoy LockhartOooooo…. Weasley got a Howler!! Needless to say, Mrs. Weasley was none-to-pleased with the car disappearing from the station. Lockhart takes his moment to brag more, but only proves he has no idea what he’s doing. Ron’s wand is malfunctioning. Harry’s got a fan in a first year named Colin. 📚Chapter 7: Mudbloods and MurmursPoor Ron can’t catch a break with that wand. He tried to curse Malfoy for calling Hermione “mudblood” and it backfired, resulting in him puking slugs. Speaking of Malfoy, his father bought his way onto the Slytherin Quidditch team. Harry hears a chilling voice.📚Chapter 8: The Deathday PartyHarry is nice to everyone, even ghosts. Nearly Headless Nick invites Harry to his deathday party. He foregoes the Halloween feast, to attend. Rotten food, cold room, screeching music… not exactly a warm blooded good time. While leaving the party, Harry heard the voice again. This time he follows it to find a message scrolled on a wall, about the chamber of secrets. 📚Chapter 9: The Writing on the WallFilch’s cat got frozen, aka petrified. Professor Binn’s explains the history of the chamber of secrets, which supposedly contains a Slytherin monster that would wipe out all non-pure-blood wizards. The trio speculate that Malfoy may be the heir of Slytherin.📚Chapter 10: The Rogue Bludger Freaking Lockhart… such a dumb dumb!! First Quidditch game against Slytherin and a bludger is targeting Harry. He end up with a broken arm, which Lockhart tries to fish, resulting in the removal of Harry’s bones. As he sits in the hospital, Harry overhears the Colin was petrified as well.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 6-10***Warning: podcast has adult content***I love the why? why? why? We all think it and none of us know. It’s all very intriguing! Like Tom’s trophy still being displayed at Hogwarts… why?? Given who he is and what he’s done, you’d think that thing would be hidden or destroyed.📚Chapter 11: The Dueling ClubPolyjuice Potion in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Hermione’s working on the potion. The whole school has heard about Colin. Lockhart starts dueling club, to keep everyone safe. Harry and Malfoy are matched up. Malfoy congers a snake and Harry speaks parseltongue in front of everyone. Another student and ghost are petrified.📚Chapter 12: The Polyjuice PotionHarry’s called to Dumbledore’s office, where he meets Fawkes the pheonix. The trio takes the polyjuice potion, Harry/Ron become Crabbe/Goyle, pointlessly, as they discovered nothing. Hermione became a cat.📚Chapter 13: The Very Secret DiaryHarry and Ron find a diary with TM Riddle on it. Ron remembers the name from a trophy. Harry discovers the diary writes back and allows him inside memories. He sees why Hagrid was expelled.📚Chapter 14: Cornelius FudgeHarry’s room was broken into and the diary stolen. Quidditch is cancelled and everyone is told the school is on lockdown. The Minister of Magic shows up to take Hagrid to Azkaban (wizard jail) and calls for Dumbledore to step down as head master.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 11-14***Warning: podcast has adult content***It’s really funny how they point out things, like Ginny being upset, so Fred and George scare her… Dumbledore asking Harry point blank if he has anything to tell him and he chooses not to. Truth. Hurts. 📚Chapter 15: Aragog Per Hagrid’s request, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the forest. They find Hagrid’s friend spider, Aragog, who is the size of a horse. The spider tells his family to eat them, but the old flying car rescued them in time.📚Chapter 16: The Chamber of SecretsGinny is still acting strange. The boys visit petrified Hermione, to find a note in her frozen hand, which identifies the monster as a type of snake. They run to tell, but overhear that Ginny was taken. They go into the pipes to find her.📚Chapter 17: The Heir of Slytherin Harry find Ginny in the chamber, with a ghostly Tom Riddle nearby. Tom shares about Ginny and his diary and his identity… Voldemort. Dumbledore’s bird Fawkes appears, carrying the sorting hat. Harry uses a sword from the hat, to kill the snake, gets bit, uses the snake fang to destroy the diary, causing Tom to disappear.📚Chapter 18: Dobby’s RewardHarry talks to Dumbledore about Voldemort. Mr. Malfoy shows up with Dobby on his heals. Harry confronts him about slipping Riddles diary to Ginny. He slips a sock into it and chucks it to Mr. Malfoy. He unknowingly freed Dobby. Lockhart and his wiped memory are no longer an issue. All the petrified get woken up. Gryffindor wins the house cup.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Chapters 15-18***Warning: podcast has adult content***They covered so much- but these last chapters covered a ton too! Main points: Why doesn’t Harry replace Ron’s wand for him? He has the money! But treats from the cart will have to do… lol…. Why does the school take so long to wake the petrified? Like those are the only Mandrakes in the world…. Dumbledore assures Harry he’s a true Gryffindor, because of his CHOICE to be in Gryffindor. 🎬Movie #2I wish they had depicted the fist fight between Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley in the movie. But alas, it was left out. But there was a lot still there, that I loved seeing come to life. Travel by floo powder…. the Mandrakes…. Harry going into the diary. I also love how Ron’s voice cracks all the time. It’s really great.🎧Podcast: Binge Mode: Movie***Warning: podcast has adult content***Hedwig!! Poor Hedwig. She does need a bigger cage and boy, oh boy, she had a rough time. Sadly the movie does skip quite a bit. Our choices define us, not our blood- what a great message overall. Hogwarts!! The safest place in the world, lol, where Voldemort has attacked Harry, twice now. I love that they manage to sum up all the thoughts with humor.Checking Chamber of Secrets off my list. Thanks for following along on my journey. Now… onto book 3! ❤️📚

The entire idea and execution were fantastic.I loved it when Dumbledore told Harry, ""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.""

In memory of Alan Rickman who showed us what Severus Snape looks like on the Big Screen.I made myself a promise not to use any stills from any Harry Potter movies in my reviews for any book of the series, but I have to make an exception today January 14, 2016 thus the image above.Even people who somehow managed to avoid reading the books and seeing the movies can guess that this book is about Harry Potter's second year the School of Wizardry, Hogwarts. Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him. Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harry's life full of excitement: he is convinced Harry's life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts, so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this. Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive. To add to the fun it seems Harry's life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at. Like the first one, this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments; children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale. We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones. Speaking about new people, Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent. His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud. I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person - he is another interesting guy; the last scene with him is excellent. I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little. I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series; he is just a guy who always gets either lucky, or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots. I saw Hermione named the main hero - she is the brainpower behind Harry's successes most of the time. I saw Neville named the main hero - he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters. I would respectfully disagree: Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one (compare him to Lockhart to see why). For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel. This was my reread of the book; I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with 4 stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early. Any book which can do it to me deserves 5 stars. I do not have anything else to add to what I already said; each installment of the series was analyzed and reviewed countless number of times by better qualified people. I will stop right here.

I am always surprised by J.K. Rowling's ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it's big and hideous problems. We all know, after all, that she covered discrimination, wars, hate crime, the Kardashians, etc.Let's take this book for example. Harry goes back to Hogwarts. Now enter Gilderoy Lockhart. A fame enamored charlatan, who knows nothing about anything, except memory spells. So clearly a Kardashian. Now some might ask: do Kardashians know memory spells. And the answer is clearly YES! Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13, so some magic must be at work, otherwise you'd have to think the world has gone mad!!!!!Carrying on, Harry has an awful year, mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language. Actually all of Harry's life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you, hence Harry might've been modeled after Lindsay Lohan. But Rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that Harry ended up fine in the end... mostly.And to crown all of this awful year, he meets Tom Riddle, who is the heir of Slytherin. He also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet. So definitely a forefather of Taylor Swift. And look at what that those family ties made her do!! Lessons to be learned from here, people!Now, of course, a lot of questions remain: will the Kardashians magic still work for long? Will Taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa? Will I finish this review already?Only time can tell...

Re-read #?: November 27-28, 2014Re-read #??: November 29-December 3, 2016While this is probably one of my least favorites of the series, it's still a fantastic book. I can't say for sure why I don't love it as much as the others, but it's just never stood out to me.However, upon rereading it, I am reminded again how great Rowling is at developing a story arc! There are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book! Especially with Tom Riddle showing up, the diary, hints of Ron's affection for Hermione, and overall just building up the characters and storyline. It's also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on.Here are some thoughts on things I noticed or didn't remember about this book while I was reading it:-Like in one of the Harry Potter video games, Ron and Harry de-gnome the Burrow's garden at the beginning of the book. -Hermione's parents actually go to Diagon Alley and exchange Muggle money at Gringott's!-Why wasn't Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party in the movie? Also he died in 1492 which is when Columbus 'discovered' America. Significant?-""And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed."" (p.231) Sounds familiar.-I really wish they had the Valentine's Day party in the movie, with all the dwarves walking around dressed as cupids and delivering love messages.-Aragog is literally my biggest fear.-Apparently Dumbledore, back in the day, was a Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.-And finally, I knew Voldemort was an heir of Slytherin, duh, but I didn't realize he was the last heir of Slytherin. Dun dun duuuun.5/5 stars because even when it's my least favorite of the seven, it's still perfect.

Second Read Review
 This book was so much fun! And I honestly enjoyed it more than the first time I read it. I didn't know how much I forgot about this book until I reread it, so I probably enjoyed it very much because I mostly forgot many things in this book. So there are also some things that I want to talk about, 
 Gilderoy Lockhart 
 He was so annoying and irked me so much. Especially in the scene where he set loose of pixies in Defence Against the Dark Arts class and he couldn't even fix this mess! And told Harry, Ron and Hermione to put them back in the cage and he left them, I was like "" what the hell? "" he's so unbelievable. But I must admit that he made me laugh like in the Duelling Club, he was disarmed by Snape and that scene was so funny until I laughed out loud. I disliked him very much for lying about those stories! He's such a liar. Ugh. Oh and he deserved what he got in the end that he lost his memory because Ron's wand backfired at him. 
Hermione Granger
I was shocked when I realized that Hermione liked Lockhart. That guy was so annoying. Maybe he was charming BUT he didn't even know any useful spells, like when Harry broke his arm, he conjured a spell and that spell caused Harry to lose his bones in his arm! He just made it worse instead of helping him. And even though I was shocked, I also laughed when I knew that Hermione put a Get Well card from lockhart under her pillow when she was in the hospital wing hahahahaha. I guess she really liked him. that scene was just so funny. 😂😂 Well, overall I really enjoyed re-reading this book and I'm going to read the third book now! Bye! ❤️••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Edit : Rounded it up into 5 starsREVIEW TO COME ON SATURDAY! ^^4.8 Stars 
"" It is our choice, Harry, That show what we truly are, Far more than our abilities ""
Okay guys, before I started reviewing this book, I wanted to tell you something. This saturday, I read this book until 04:30 am and I completely didn't realise that I was reading for 4 hours or so and on that same day I had an economy course with my teacher and I completely forgot about that too until my mom reminded me of it. the course started at 10:00 am o'clock and I woke up at 11:00 am and maybe I'll get into a little bit trouble when I'm coming to school on Monday because of this. But I really couldn't help it! THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD AND I COULD NOT STOP READING IT!! okay now let's talking about this book! 
My Opinion
omg! this book! I had a lot of feelings! Anger. Sadness. Happiness and many more and the chapter I most loved was The Duelling Club. it was so funny to see Professor Snape disarmed Lockhart until he was flying because of the impact of Professor Snape's spell hahaha. xDI don't like calling Lockhart a Professor because he clearly didn't know any spells that were usefull for his students or anyone... Maybe just a Memory Charm. but it was only usefull for him to do his nasty business. ugh and he was a liar too. all those books he wrote were all faked. If Hogwarts were real, I would be really happy to learn all about Defence Against The Dark Arts. this is the most interesting subject that have really caught my interest since I began reading the first book. what about you guys? tell me on the comment section below! ^^and that Duelling Club was so amazing! learning how to fight with spells! and what schocked me was that Voldemort was used to be a human! and Voldemort was not his real name. His real name was Tom Marvolo Riddle but he changed it. I mean, not an ordinary human,of course. he was a half-blood. his father was a muggle and his mother was a witch. I knew he was a Slytherin and he studied at Hogwarts too but I never thought him as half-blood was or a child or a teenager. because he was so evil that I couldn't even imagine what he would look like in the past and he *coughs coughs * used to be handsome...oh! I love Quidditch too! I don't really like sports but it's different with Quidditch. Quidditch is wonderful and amazing! I even always scream like "" YOU CAN DO IT HARRY! YOU CAN CATCH IT!"" and when Gryffindor wins I always scream like "" YAY!! GRYFFINDOR! GRYFFINDOR! "" Am I weird? hahaaha. AHHH. I wish Hogwarts were real. I wish I were at least a muggle-born. I have only read two books in Harry Potter series but they already have changed my life. thank you guys for reading and liking this review! I hope you guys have a great day and Happy Reading!! ❤❤

Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal. I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character, Professor Lockhart. Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself, and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his ""heroism"" and great knowledge of the magic arts. (view spoiler)[Riiiiiiiiight. (hide spoiler)] In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot. Hence the five stars. :)(view spoiler)[Very clever Ms. Rowling, very clever indeed. (hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE: ""I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with,"" said Ernie swiftly.""It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,"" said Harry.

When everyone first read and loved Harry Potter I ignored it. Not for any particular reason but about 10 years ago I didn't think I would be into it. Fast forward a decade and I'm now working my way through what I can say already is a children's classic fantasy series that is up there with The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia. Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car. Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics. A new tutor is introduced this time, Professor Lockhart and I thought he was brilliant mainly due to how awful he was with his tall-tales and celebrity status! This narrative is brimming with ghosts, boys and girls who adore Harry, spiders, and Professor Sprout. The characters are pretty brilliant and I can easily understand why this is adored globally. I didn't need the continuous info-dumps that reminded me what happened in book one but apart from that there isn't really anything negative to say. The ending was surprising with a cool twist, a magic hat, a phoenix, a sword, a diary, and a giant snake. I hope you don't tell me off for these spoilers as I'm sure I'm the only fantasy book reviewer who hasn't read these yet. I'm loving the adventure so far. These books are what I go to for now when I want no-nonsense, uncomplex awesomeness. Love it.

I cannot believe I had this much patience in me to give more than a year gap after reading the first book!Damn!2021, you are making me shine all over again!Bless you, book 2! Fantasy, mystery, adventure done right. The way it has been written is so simple that it's just impossible not to enjoy. Everything is so damn vivid and entertaining! Things are well-balanced. There aren't anything underwhelming or overwhelming parts I have come across this series. I watched the entire movie series adaptation years ago and thankfully, none of it made sense that time and I am so GLAD I cannot remember anything happening there except for the actors' faces in my head while reading the books.I loved the first book. It was so much better than watching a good movie. I could feel the action, adventure and the dialogues more with the book.And this sequel is amazing as heck too!I feel the first half was a bit slow but it's the second half that got the legs of my imagination run it's winning race until the end!Malfoy is annoying (bless him!), the spells are happening real, more strict rules to break and, of course, Hermione and Ron are becoming more endearing with Harry not smiling at all because he's Harry Potter! Dumbledore, you never fail to impress me. I wish there were more parts of the characters. But it's fine. I wasn't bored even for a moment there.The entire read was a fun fest for me.I woke up knowing it's Sunday. The reading gods cast a spell on me at 6.30 am and I started reading the book. And now I feel magical!I am feeling so proud of the characters, including the jerks and the scoffing teachers at Hogwarts. I say nothing would have been this perfect without any of you.There are more dramatic characters in this one. The ghosts, the side characters...and I don't think I will ever get to see a detailed story description of anyone belonging to my house, Hufflepuff. I know we are all Slytherin here but I need to know a Hufflepuff soon. Are you there in 3, 4, 5, 6 or the dreaded 7th?

 Summer with the Dursleys has been excruciating. Cut-off from the magical world, Harry is alone. He is more than excited to return to his favourite place in the world, Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but receives the strangest warning from a house elf. He tells him that Hogwarts will be a dangerous place for Harry to be this year. But Harry doesn't want to stay with the Dursleys all year. So with the help of Ron and a flying car, Harry is off to his second year despite the spooky warning he received.The year starts off normally, though when Harry begins to hear voices that no one else seems to hear and it becomes unsafe for students in the castle for fear of attack, he realizes that he should have taken that warning more seriously. Strange and dangerous things are indeed walking the halls of Hogwarts.
“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”
It's clear that there is an improvement in JKR's writing. What the Philosopher's Stone lacked, this book had. The side characters are more fleshed out and we get to explore new parts of Hogwarts! I loved the ‘new’ characters introduced, like Dobby, Lockhart and Moaning Myrtle.  Lockhart was obviously very annoying sometimes but he brought a great element of humour that the story needed. The mystery aspect of each of these books will always be a favourite, even if I already know what's going to happen. It's the small details of everyday life at Hogwarts that makes this world seem so vividly real to me. I love finding all the Easter eggs that will come into play in the later books. It's so amazing how something as inconsequential as a wardrobe has its own significance that you'll only pick up on further down the road. This re-read was the best idea and I'm having an awesome time slowly convincing Fares (who I'm buddy reading with) that this is an epic series.______My reviews for:1:  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban4: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

Since pretty much everyone I know has read these books, I figure reviewing them is pretty pointless. But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as someone who's just getting into Freudian theory.From the very beginning, the true nature of this story is quite obvious - The Chamber of Secrets. There is only one ""chamber of secrets"" that is of any human concern, and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman.By sending her young, immature male character, Harry (whose name, along with Tom and Dick, just happens to be one of the ""universal"" male names) into the mysterious Chamber, Rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality. The Chamber is filled not only with mystery, but danger and legend - its very existence is debated, which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasm.Ms. Rowling, whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years, is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction. She has created a perfect sexual explorer in Harry Potter - a young, innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured. Obviously a male that Rowling would feel comfortable with. This is especially interesting given the actual resident of the Chamber of Secrets - a huge, deadly serpent. And there's only one thing that a huge, terrible serpent can represent.Rowling's sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown. It is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that she's repressed from her former sexual life, the one she regrets more than anything else, by manufacturing a hero. That hero, in Harry Potter, represents the type of man for whom she would ""open"" her ""chamber - pure of heart and noble of intention and, most importantly, under her control. The vanquishing of the serpent-symbol is her victory, leaving her free to explore other aspects of her life, including the eventual resolution of the Electra complex that appears to have been built up around Professor Dumbledore...

They're all fleshed out.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting, thrilling read. It makes you think along with the Golden Trio and laugh out loud. It makes you cheer characters on and boo others. You're engaged for the entire story and there's no way out. You can't escape. Hogwarts is your home.

Hm. Okay. So I didn’t love that one. I liked it, I did! But it didn’t have the same irresistible charm as Sorcerer’s Stone for me.I’m being vague but I don’t know if I can specify. Let me try to.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...For one thing, this didn’t have the same mastery of language as the first. It seemed in Sorcerer’s Stone that every word was a careful choice. Here, the phrase “after all” was used three times in one measly paragraph. It wasn’t poorly written by any stretch of the imagination...but it could be a bit sloppy.Two: not as exciting. The second act plot-line may have been better than the first book’s, but it took forever to get to that point. The first two-thirds or three-quarters of this book dragged for me, really. And I needed some excitement to break up the endless studying and work of finals week!Three: as I mentioned in my HPSS review, my favorite part of this series is the worldbuilding. Every aspect of this world drips with magic, and it’s so lovely. I’ll never tire of reading about Diagon Alley, or Hogwarts feasts, or Quidditch - and I cannot wait for Hogsmeade! There was a lot less discussion of the world here. God, how I wish there was. Is there more in the other books? It seems there’d have to be in Goblet of Fire, no?Four: I missed Hermione! I didn’t realize how much of the appeal of this series for me was based on her. At least this book really confirmed my adoration of her. Absolutely one of the best YA characters ever, in my opinion. I missed Neville, too! At least Hermione had a reason for not being there, but where was the lovely Neville this whole time?Five: In general, this book seemed a bit...stuck. Sorcerer’s Stone has a great variety of characters, and features different classes and aspects of Hogwarts life. This installment gave me cabin fever. The whole thing is limited almost entirely to Harry and Ron. They’re great, don’t get me wrong, but...I wanted there to be other people too. Hagrid wasn’t here much, nor Fred and George. Quidditch only happened, what, once? The only class truly described was Lockhart’s, which made me want to bang my head against the wall. In short, I missed everybody. All the new characters introduced here are just unbearable. (Colin, Lucius, Gilderoy...even Dobby at some points. Sorry.)On the bright side, I don’t think this is anybody’s favorite Harry Potter book. I’m a bit deflated, but overall rather excited to get on with this reread. (Once a few of my finals are done with, though. Shiver.)Bottom line: every series has its weak points. I’m still thrilled to be doing this reread, and am sure I’ll love the next one!

This might be the only series where I, at least close to, love every character.  “Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.” “Honestly, if you were any slower, you’d be going backward.”  And the storyline is absolutely fantastic! J.K Rowling truly has a magical imagination. Short ""review"", if you can even call this a review, because I´m heading strait in to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

At least in the eyes of Draco ""Not-Yet-A-Ferret"" Malfoy, his stupid father and old Voldy. Harry, of course, is far too clever to believe in such nonsense, not only because his best friend is both a muggleborn and the cleverest person in like, the entire history of mankind. Not only because of their very different perspective on one's (non-)magical background, this is the first of the two big Draco vs. Harry books. The first time they fight each other at Quidditch, the Heir of Slytherin haunting the halls of Hogwarts, etc., etc. It's actually my least favourite of all these seven books but it's still great. It has Dobby (Oh, my), it has Ron and Harry's brilliant idea to go to school in a flying car, and my all-time-favourite character, Ginny Weasley, is finally coming to Hogwarts.

The second installment of the Harry Potter series, The Chamber of Secrets, was not my kid's favorite (he wants me to hurry up and get to #4) and admittedly, is was not as good as The Philosopher's Stone. It was humorous and exciting, but sometimes I wanted to hit Harry in the head for missing obvious clues. The Lockhart character was (intentionally, I admit) very annoying. The outcome was somewhat predictable (especially for Lockhart) and there were moments that the reminders of what happened in the previous book were annoying. The spider episode in the Forbidden Forest seemed transparently inspired by The Hobbit. There were some plot inconsistencies too:: Harry is already dressed for the game when he goes to the quidditch dressing room; in the bookstore where Lockhart makes his first appearance, he doesn't have time to buy his books before the egotistical maniac makes a spectacle of him. Ok, perhaps I am being picky, but I think this was one of the weaker books leading up to the last four which were more epic (at least according to my 10yo self-professed HP expert!)I read about half the book and listened to the second half in the Stephen Fry-narrated book on Audible. Mr. Fry did a great job with the voices and was very agreeable to listen to. Looking forward now to re-reading Azkaban!

The book itself flows smoothly without dropping. Harry, Ron and Hermione are the lead characters that I love most. They try to carry out their plans about the clue that left behind. I enjoyed watching the way they solve the problem and while they're conducting something, Ron is the one that always made me laugh out loud. Hermione is the brain of this group, though, she's smart and subtle. And Harry is the brave one, although he is so scared about the whispers, he drives into the pipe without hesitation in the end. I really adored him !This book is entertaining for many reasons. Lockhart is a colorful character, without him, this book will not be complete. The only thing I want to say about this series is it gets better and better. When you pick the book up, you can't put it down for hours. Harry Potter is my addiction and life. That's all !!

The way he portrays the characters and emphasises everything really does bring the magic to life.Fred and George Weasley are at the moment my current favourites of the series. I just find them so hilarious and like to tease the ones they care about.What I liked?- The Gnomes at the Weasleys!- We got to meet Hermiones family and them exchanging real money at Gringotts- THE HOWLER MESSAGE. Oh my god. I can’t even begin to explain how much I loved that part!- I found Colin hilarious, he was just so adorable and desperately trying to get glimpses of Harry. Not only this but the signing of the photos oh god, I can’t.- Deathday party! That was soon good! How ghosts made an entrance, loveeeeee!- FAWKES! - Dumbledores sweet tooth, I was like yep yep yep.- How motherly Professor McGonagall is, I’m just like N’awww!-Gilderoy Lockhart. His character was so well done! Everything he did had me laughing, the valentines day shenanigans with the dwarves and the wings and the songs- The never ending rivalry between Draco, Ron and Harry-In fact just how protective Ron is with Hermione melts my little heart!- Hagrid still has me howlingWhat I didn’t like?- Once again this is probably only me… we have such a build up throughout the book which is so well done, I just think that it all ends very suddenly. Where was my boy Neville?!Overall I’m still enjoying this series so much I can’t wait to start Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

This book was so difficult to rate it, because its was a great book but at the same time it didn’t pass my expectation, of being better than the first one. It was a little bit boring, but it was still incredible. It took me to read this book more for what is expected.What I really like about the book is the life lesson that it has. The life lesson that this book is that we shouldn't trust what everyone says, and also not everything is what we see., in the part when Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) revealed his real name. “Tom Marvolo Riddle” paragraph 2 page 314, “rearranged themselves: I am Lord Voldemort” paragraph 3 and 4 page 314. Also when Gilderoy Lockhart revealed that he actually didn’t did all the heroic things that were writing in his book. “all that stuff you did in your books” paragraph 7 page 297, “Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart” paragraph 8 page 297. Another event in the book that show this lesson was when Lucius Malfoy planned to give the diary Ginny Weasley, “You gave it to her” “slipped the diary” paragraph 11 page 336. But the most important event of all that show this was when Ginny trust the diary and gave all her secrets to it, “Put too much into the diary to me” paragraph 2 “From anything Ginny had told me” paragraph 1, page 313. In this book you could also see that Harry was more mature in the way of thinking, like for example when he found out all about the chamber secrets, with a little bit of time and with no so many clues. And it really impressed me that he found it, because if I was him the school would be already closed when I just found out only one clue of the puzzle.As well in this book they showed more about the history of the school and of some characters such as Hagrid and Dumbledore. An example would be when Harry found out, what did Hagrid did to be expelled from HogwartsIn the end, I really like the book and how they continued where they left the last book, also I will still continue watching the series because I really like it, and is like the only book that can get me out of a reading slump. I will rate this book a 4.5 because it was good but also it was not as good as the first one.UpdateFour years after I read it for the first time, and now I like it even more, than the first book. It just surprised me that even though I have seen the movies multiple times and have already read them, I was still surprised, when they revealed information or solved a mystery, and I can't understand why, but it did. So now I'm giving this book 5 stars and the first one 4.5 stars. It's amazing how after four years my opinion about this book changed.

DestinyHere I am with The Chamber of Secrets, the second book of the Harry Potter series feeling the tightening grip of adoration, as I get ensnared in the glorious bewitching world created by JK Rowling. Certainly, the first book and now the second, primarily introduce us to the extensive cast of characters that inhabit this sweeping magical world. The background behind Hogwarts and the major divisions that shaped their history become apparent, and how they drive the plot over the entire series, is intelligently, delicately and profoundly imagined.I love Rowling’s patience, the ability to subtly drop a piece of information that may not mean anything for a few books. To drip actions and comments that at some point in the future you’re saying “Oh, That’s what that was for.” – Genius. The relationship between Ginny and Harry is kindled in this book and we also meet Dobby, with the unforgettable line “Dobby is Harry Potter's friend.” The background to Hogwarts and the 4 wizards and witches who founded it, is described, where each house was named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. These names have become part of our reference, as in real-life people connect themselves to these houses and what type of person they wish to be. The rift and disagreements between Slytherin and the rest grew until Slytherin left the school. The history also states that 
Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. ‘Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.’
That is a direct charge against Hermione and others who come from a muggles family, yet she is the smartest student in her year at Hogwarts. We see the gradual ramping up of tension within the school and why Malfoy hates muggles calling them mudbloods. The relationships and bonds between Harry, Ron and Hermione are aspired to in most friendships and are very well-formed here. On one incident they find Mrs Norris the caretaker’s cat 'petrified' with the following words written on the wall. 
“THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.”
 The tension builds. A dark unseen force awaits. The brave, indomitable Harry Potter and his loyal friends, Ron and Hermione, will take this battle on – (view spoiler)[is it a spoiler to say there are 7 books so they don’t die yet (hide spoiler)].There is always an opportunity for humour either in what someone says or does (typically Ron and the other Weasleys), or characters that are strange and provide a comic outlet. In this book, Professor Lockhart provides that mix of cringe behaviour and comedy. His desire to receive praise and recognition, regardless of the fact that it is undeserved, and regularly exposed, except to those infatuated by his charisma, provides a light-hearted element. Funny how one person’s appeal is another’s repulsion.The scene is set, the dark wizards, led by Voldemort (yet to be revealed), against those that provide defence against them, led by Dumbledore and somehow (yet to be revealed) Harry. When will Voldemort return? Why is Harry so important in all this? Will history repeat itself? Damn most of us know the ending but reading the books just brings so much craft and ingenuity into the story that reading them is a must. Someone will do research on this series someday as its depth sits alongside Lord of the Rings. Bring on book 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban.

I want to live here please. *Mr & Mrs. Weasley. Adopt me, please. *Dobby and the whole pudding fiasco!

That he infcat talked of little else the whole damn summer except for “wonderful Potter with his scarand his broomstick”. This is cannon. I cannot even. *Gilderoy motherfuckjng Lockhart LOL. His autograph scenes! When he tells Harry he might be famous enough one day to keep his own stack of autographs handy, When he made Harry reenact all his äccomplishements.” When he tried to duel Snape! 😂😂😂*Mr. Weasley and Lucius Malfoy throwing hands at the bookstore! I DIE! *When HArry and Ron immediately decide to fly to Hogwarts. Like the absolute mad lads! Immediately jumping into the most chaotic plan! *The Whopping Willow attempting murder because someone touched it. Honestly, SAME. *The Deathday Party. I too would like to be able to throw a post mortem party when I die. Why stop the party at death amirite???*Moaning Myrtle moping around and just wanting to be left the fuck alone but also thriving for the drama?? She is me at 16. Seriously. *The general creepy ambiance of this whole book, the mystery. It’s such a step away from the cherry magic of the first. It really sets a more serious (hur) tone for later books in the series. The dismembered Basilisk voice is also one of my favourite things. It's just so creepy? *Hermoine breaking about a million school rules and making the polyjuice potion in an abandoned haunted bathroom after stealing the ingredients from Snape's office! She just went from 0-100 and honestly, this is my favourite version of her. The sheer balls really. *The Dueling Club, while it lasted, is also one of my favourite things about this book. It’s where Harry learns his infamous expelliarmus spell, from Snape of all people. It also forms a precursor of sorts to the DA later on in book 5. *Harry speaking Parseltongue. I know why he loses this ability later on but damn, I want to be able to speak to snakes. *The first of what will, undoubtedly, be many more visits to Dumbledore's office. Harry meeting Fawkes for the first time. *Hagrid being a sweetheart and standing up for Harry. Always. *Slytherin’s common room under the lake. It speaks to my need for the dramatic and I love it. *The fact that Harry is constantly drawn to Riddle’s diary because of the horcrux inside him recognizing it’s other part just blows my mind. This was just book 2 and the clues are scattered so far back its insaneeee!!! This also sets up the beginning of many, many parallels between Harry and Voldemorth; similarities that start to converge by the end of the series. *That fucking Valentine’s day event!! The surly dwarves as cupids! Ginny’s poem! Lockhart suggesting people ask professor snape for a love potion, the mad lad!! Professor Flitwick looking like he’s on the verge of tears from the sheer disgrace of it all!! I DIEEEEE!!!*Riddle. I die laughing every time I read this part. The fact that Voldemorth’s 16 year old self is just such a self important emo kid. The grand villain monologuing? The side smirks? The threats?? Pure fucking gold!! He's supposed to threatening and all, and generally he makes for a terrific villain. But here he’s just Tom and he's 16 and he's just doing these crazy grand Shakespearean monologues and I just find it so terribly funny every time!*The whole diary reveal when Harry finally (finally) solves the mystery. The visual of Harry piercing the diary and all this black ink just dripping out dramatically like blood. My emo teen ass really loved this imagery and I must say I still do. *Lockhart losing his memory from his own memory charm! I just love s dude so, so much you guys!!!*Lucius Malfoy being an absolute snob! He’s such a drama queen, like I totally get where Malfoy gets it from. I adore him! Also I cannot imagine Lucius Malfoy as anyone other than Jason Isaacs with his beautiful blonde wig and cane! What an absolute ICON!*Harry freeing Dobby with the whole sock in diary thing! I love! Honestly, there is probably a whole lot more but these will do for now. Again, objectively speaking, this would probably be a 3.75 stars. But I love this series and cannot read it without remembering it as a whole. So, forgive the biased 5 stars rating.

""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.""Harry, Hermione and Ron return to Hogwarts for their second school year. There's a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Ginny Weasley has taken a shine to Harry… but the real trouble begins when a number of Hogwarts students are ""petrified"" and rendered immobile. The heir of Slytherin is suspected to be behind these attacks, but who is the heir?These first few books kinda feel like we're laying the groundwork for the ""real"" story, which is on its way and will take place from book 3 onwards. I think that's why I view Chamber of Secrets as my least favourite in the series. The first book is special because it's the beginning, we're discovering Hogwarts and the magical world of Harry Potter… but then the second book just isn't as enjoyable as I view it as merely a stepping stone to the real meat of the story. It's still pretty great though... I mean, there isn't one HP book I dislike!One of my favourite aspects of the Chamber of Secrets is finding out more about Voldemort's background. The scenes in the chamber itself are great as more tidbits are unravelled and he reveals exactly what has been going on. Another highlight of Chamber of Secrets is the introduction of Dobby!! He has a big heart and means well… even if he almost kills Harry in the process. Oops. Once again, Hermione is the MVP and proves yet again that those two would have not got very far without her. Hermione is basically the Samwise Gamgee of Harry Potter. I also like how Malfoy seems to have a bigger role in this story, he's fun to hate at this point. This book also introduces us to Gilderoy Lockhart - his narcissism literally cracks me up and I love that Hermione harbours a little crush for him. Colin also slays me when he is obsessed with Harry!I just love how much I actually snigger to myself when reading these books. It's such a testament to Rowling's writing that she has created this story that will fascinate children of all ages, and yet you can equally enjoy it as an adult. Harry Potter transcends all ages! And that is truly magical. 4 glittering sparkly stars!

It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.  Plot:  This book picks up with Harry once again spending the summer with his family at number 4 privet drive. Waiting for the summer to end so he can finally return to Hogwarts and be with his new found friends Ron and Hermione. However the journey to getting there isn't the best because Dobby the house elf thinking he's doing Harry a favour stops him from walking through the barrier making him and Ron miss the train so they result to flying a car to school. The school year starts of bad for Harry and Ron with them almost getting expelled from the school, but things at the school start to go from odd to strange where the teachers and students life's are put in danger when the Chamber of Secrets is re-opened after 50 years. Even though Chamber of secrets isn't one of my favourites in the series i was listening to this for the first time via audiobook and say since growing older and reading it a few more times i can understand appreciate the story more since i've matured.  Characters:   Harry Potter:  Harry is put to his second ultimate test in the second book after a shocking start to the school year harry finds himself dealing with all the crazy laws and accusations that have come with the chamber of secrets being opened. After its revealed that he can talk to snakes the whole school and some teachers become skeptical about him and this begins his year of trying to prove everyone in the school wrong. I'm glad Harry has Ron and Hermione who believed him from the beginning because if they didn't i feel like Harry would be on his own entirely. As the school year progresses and some of the muggle born students. mrs norris and nearly headless nick are petrified it all comes down to harry to stop it from happening to any more people, were harry meets voldemort for the second time and naturally defeats him.  Ron Weasley:  Ron is one of Harry's best friends throughout the entire series and he provides the comedic relief and trys to see things as rational as he can. I feel like Ron is very underestimated out of the three and its because he is shunned between a famous boy and a clever witch, but i think Ron has an edge on both of the two since he is from a family who grew up in this wizard world so i think it gives him more information that the other two don't know. Ron is also dealing with being put on a scale so high because of who his brothers are and how well they've all done in school so i feel ron knows it and has that to deal with.  Hermione Granger:  One of my favourite characters in this series, because she is truly the brightest witch of her age and i love how she doesn't care what anybody things about her in the way she is so smart and how she looks even though she does get teased by Malfoy and the rest of slytherin because of this. Hermione is the one who fights for whats right and brings a lot of political issues to the surface that this wizarding world seems to be having and yes this world has it's troubles that effect not only Hermione but every muggle born student, house elf etc. She does grow from the first book but don't get me wrong she doesn't change from being that geeky girl who loves to learn which i love about this character. When in doubt, go to the library.  Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world. This is one series that i will always continue to come back to because it's what got me into reading and got me started for my love of books and i will always be thankful for Jo for writing this magical series. I honestly can't thank her enough because this series is and always will be important to me.

About a year ago I threw a tantrum begged Delee to read Harry Potter with me. She had never read it and I just simply can’t accept that.

AND we’ve scheduled our reading of Prisoner of Azkaban for August** of this year. I’m one excited Potthead!Chamber of Secrets catches some heat from fans for being too much like the first one. But, I assure you it’s really not that similar. Sure, there’s our favorite trio once again keeping secrets from adults who could totally use that information. Sure, there’s something sinister going on in the school causing everyone’s feathers to be ruffled. Sure, there’s a Professor who isn’t exactly who he says he is.But, this story is different. And damn it, it is FUN. I can’t tell you, now, how many times I have reread this series. What I can  tell you is that every single time this one gets funnier and funnier. There was more than one occasion where my giggling fits caused the bed to shake leading to Jerrid’s disgruntled complaints. His grumblings went unnoticed though, for how am I to show any self-control whenever Professor Lockhart is in the room? JK Rowling’s books are something truly special, something that will live within us for the rest of our lives. The quotes from these books are as engrained in our brains as our own names. I look forward to continuing this journey with Delee. I can only hope that there will be others that will follow her lead and give these books a chance when they thought them not worth their time. Trust me on this, if you’re not reading these books you’re making a huge mistake. Just remember what Dumbledore says: “It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” You’re my next victim prospect, Jeff. Best be ready, MahFah.

So, what is Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets?Why perhaps one of the greatest sequels ever written?Ha! Then why is it the lowest rated of the 7? Why do so many consider it to be their least favorite?I don't know! I thought it was flipping amazing.Why?Because Jo Rowling, so very English and erudite, with her topsy turvy hilarious and creepy narrative, her human characters and her timeless topics; Jo, who knows the human heart like Hermione knows the works of Gilderoy Lockhart, hides the motives of every character till the perfect moment of revelation. Even those that should be above suspicion are not with the taint of pride and ambition, and even the most beloved characters breathe with the fragility of humanity as the story relentlessly runs along through the darkened halls of Hogwarts. Beware, second-year students, the desire to be great is a double-edged sword beset with rubies.I first became a fan of Jo with Cuckoo's Calling and it occurred to me, breathlessly reading through Chamber of Secrets, that the Riddle was solved. Finally. Why is Jo Rowling so good? It's simple. She's a mystery writer.Harry Potter soars above Muggle mystery books because of its special additives. Magic, yes, and undeniably malleable lenient fantasy elements that Jo masterfully weaves and waves her wand over to manipulate and beef up the story as she sees fit, but truly, how many mysteries have we read (collectively) where we set them down and forget who the detective was, or the suspect, or whatever. Why is that? Because of Jo's reverse engineering (no doubt an ancient Slytherin technique) where the character comes first. No matter what, and no matter which character. The books are entirely character driven and because we love The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named and The Weasleys and Rubeus Hagrid and Ginny (the cutest human being on planet earth) and on and on and on, we find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with our would-be sleuths and puzzle solvers and their ""we must we must"" attitude. Chamber of Secrets was an outstanding mystery, chock-full of red herrings, an incredible combative climax, and too many laugh-out-loud lines to count. Dear Diary, I have a new favorite book.Oh really, what is it?*Throws diary out the window and runs away screaming*And, shivers, at the mere mention of Azkaban, I read Chamber of Secrets with far too much excitement and anticipation, because, knowing I was going into Harry Potter, The Prisoner of Azkaban, following Chamber of Secrets, was the book I was waiting for the most, and for that I blame Gary Oldman. (I am a Sirius fan of Gary Oldman) That said, I had no idea that Chamber of Secrets would be so outstanding and leave me thinking the incredible Philosopher's Stone was a perfectly-pitched welcome handshake compared to the books to come.For those who like to feel up a book for flaws, I have none, and I see none. I see the sheer verve of adventure and the scintillating luster of mystery, gleaming hungry-eyed and ready for more. You see, as Philosopher's Stone was about love, Chamber of Secrets was about fearlessness. Fearlessness to speak the truth in the face of a lie, fearlessness to stand up for what's inside your heart. Fearlessness to take a leap of faith and follow the path of destiny.Also, I am very interested in how the issues gain maturity as Harry and the other characters age. Obviously there are deaths to come, but in the case of Chamber of Secrets versus Philosopher's Stone, I could feel that sense of maturity creeping in just a bit, and am so very excited for the continuation of the series (I'll have to go buy some more chocolate frogs now) as everything in the Wizarding World becomes increasingly dangerous and unhinged and wild and wondrously unforgettable.Recommended for everyone.And 50 points for Hermione for being epic even whilst being petrified.

There is an advantage in rereading a series like Harry Potter, and that is knowing how it all ended, to see its connectivity as it builds toward its climax. When I first read it, over 15 years ago, I had no idea what will be in store for the coming installments. So, this book was just another adventure of Harry Potter where he yet again displayed his heroism. But now, when I'm revisiting them, I can see how Rowling has shaped the series and build up from book to book her story of good against evil. Lord Voldermort, as any Potter fan will know, is the evil incarnation. His power, however, was defeated, by a power far more powerful, a power the dark lord never comprehended, and that was the power of love. It all fits the theme - good vs evil. But Rowling also wants to show that evil doesn't take the defeat too kindly and that it lurks in every dark corner, ready to pounce again. And so, Lord Voldermort hunts Harry so he could crush the good that is associated with him and defeat the forces that fight to preserve the good in the world. Returning to the book, I found this daring adventure of Harry to be exciting and fascinating. This is the first full-blown adventure of Harry after learning of his magical inheritance. This adventure allows Harry yet again to prove his courage and loyalty which he does admirably. Reading the book was like a positive antidote to the present hard times, where we tend to lose hope and courage. Harry's fighting nature, the determination to do what's right, and his courage, even knowing he is no match for the power that he challenges, makes us question whether we tend to give up at the very moment that we should fight. About the creative genius of Rowling, I'm not about to harp afresh. I said that in my review of the first book of the series, and I'll leave it there. But I would like to mention what I've quite missed out on in my first reading; that is satire and humor. Rowling injects both of these subtly through the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. I think all of us must, at some point in our lives, have met the sorts of Gilderoy Lockharts, those who take credit for other people's honors. :) I liked how Rowling made Harry instrumental in exposing his deception and humbling his vanity while fighting a bigger battle with Lord Voldermort.There is one more thing I want to mention before I wind up my review and that, with a big apology to all the Ronald Weasley fans. It looks like that all through my first reading, I haven't truly appreciated Ron's character. I've seen him only as ""the faithful"" who follows the ""master"". But this second reading of the book made me see the individuality of his character, which to me was closed by Harry's bravery and Hermione's brains. But I'm slowly beginning to realize that without Ron's steadfast support and loyalty, perhaps, it wouldn't have been quite easy for either of them to shine as they did. I'm quite warming to the series again and remembering all the pleasure of my first reading. I was in awe then, and I'm still, even now.

Fantasy is a huge aspect but there is also a mystery woven in. Each book has it's own mystery but there is also an overall mystery throughout the series. Chamber of Secrets is, by far, the best mystery in the entire series. It was fascinating. It was creepy. But most of all, it was so well written. I said this in my review of Philosopher's Stone but Rowling is so talented at leaving tiny clues about what's to come and about the reveal but she does so in a way that you only notice it if you're looking for it.Some other things I loved about this book -Moaning Myrtle Petrification (spooky) Professor Lockhart (he's so dumb)Overall, this is definitely in the top three of this series and I cannot recommend it enough. -----------yup. definitely one of the best.review to come------------part 2/8 of the harry potter re-readthis book is one of my favorite in the series| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram

Spoilers ahead:I appreciate that Harry is a young 12 year old kid and so he has help all through this book, his friends and even Dumbledore. Some people think the end is too pat, but I think it is modeled after mythology. I feel it's very obvious that Jo knows her mythology deeply. She understands the role of things in a story and everything for a great myth is here. Harry has to stand against Tom on his own, but he still has help from Dumbledore in the form of Fawkes. I have read these books many times now and it's as thrilling to read them now as it was back in 2000. Jo has all the ducks in a row and she doesn't miss many tricks here. We can see hints for the rest of the series that I know will pay off later. It's a fantastic book that deserves a place in history. It's also interesting reading about Gilderoy - a narcissist, while we have one as president at the moment. It's interesting to see the similarities. They are all puffed up saying they can do everything when in reality, they don't seem to be good at much, really.I would find it interesting to know how much has been written by people about these books. I bet its billions of words at least. My niece and nephew have recently read these books and they watch the movies on repeat. They simply love the world of Harry Potter. What I love about Jo's writing style is it appeals to children while an easy read for adults. During the publication of this series, there were many adults reading these books and enjoying them at the time. Many people, aunts, uncles, cousins, moms, in my family would read them and then we would discuss them. It's a series the whole family can enjoy.It got a whole generation reading and I love that about these books. It was written when the movies for Lord of the Rings were delighting audiences and the two things together brought the Fantasy genre mainstream in a new way. Most people in the world have heard of Harry Potter.I love these books so much and I'm loving being able to do another re-read and enjoy what Jo has crafted.

Aside from being a play, it's also a more mature, character-driven, less magical story. It does not feel like an eighth Harry Potter book at all; there's a real disconnect between this play and the other seven novels. And you know what? I'm so glad. I guess it's just what you're hoping for. To be honest, I never wanted another Harry Potter book. The thought of extending a series I loved so much actually made me NOT want to read this. I got to the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and thought it was magical perfection - the story had completed its arc in full and I put it aside feeling a slight melancholy, but a whole lot of satisfaction. I didn't want more.However, if you went crazy needing more from the HP series, you'll probably be disappointed by this. If you feel there's a gap where something HP is missing, then I don't think this will fill it. Separate the two in your mind, and you have a better chance of liking it. Because this is something different - and I'm happy about it.First, of course, it's a play. Right away it's going to be something unlike what we've seen before. I don't usually love to read plays, especially modern ones, but this one is very readable because the dialogue is wonderful. I don't know why people are saying ""it's so obvious JKR didn't write most of this"" because I think her style is all over it - the very fact that this play (which is meant to be viewed on stage) can be just as easily read like a book tells me JKR had a lot of input.Also, it's funny. Much more consistently comical than the books, but with the same style of humour - i.e. lots of Ron being a buffoon. 
Hermione: If some part of Voldemort survived, in whatever form, we need to be prepared. And I’m scared.Ginny: I’m scared too.Ron: Nothing scares me. Apart from Mum.
The plot leaves a little something to be desired. Again, it feels different from the main series. It's not so much about the world and magic, but more about relationships, conflicts (particularly between Harry and Albus) and the dialogue between characters. I suppose this makes more sense in a play, where the story unravels through dialogue and not through an omniscient narrator.And, as I touched upon earlier, it feels... older. I don't know how well kids will appreciate the jokes about growing old and how Ron now says ""oof"" every time he sits down. Or the family drama between Harry and his son, Albus. But I liked it. I'm happy with this addition. I truly am. If it had been too similar to the seven novels, I feel it would have risked reopening a series that had been closed in a great place. Instead, we have something very unique and, for me, very entertaining. Some of the staging directions also leave me excited about seeing the play (when I win the lottery or acquire a magic wand, maybe).One thing I have to say that I said in another comment thread: NOW, it's time to stop. This was a risky experiment and it turned out to be fun, but JKR needs to leave this world alone now. I really do not want to read about old-age Harry, Ron and Hermione rolling around in magical wheelchairs. So, just stop.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store

It was lovely to see them again. It was like meeting old friends.I don't feel old. I'm a more responsible person, for sure, but I feel young at heart. When we're young, adulthood, responsibilities, just the prospect of adulting seem so daunting...then one gets there and it's like, well, I'm as immature as I ever was. I love fun as much as I ever did. Growing old isn't that bad. And seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart.I could do without the kids, to be honest. Oh, sure, they're little Potter and Granger-Weasley spawns, but come on, nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents, whom I have loved the instant we met them on the Hogwarts Express.(Ok, maybe not Ron...)But I digress. The kids aren't all bad. I rather like little Scorpius, actually.
SCORPIUS: And it’s just like my father’s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that’s a great thing either. I mean — father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I’d rather be a Malfoy than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.
The adults have grown, they've changed. Some have changed so much that I hardly recognize them, Draco, for instance. I like that he's, well, nicer now, but he doesn't feel like Draco, you know? I've been so used to Harry and Draco doing this...That it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise.But yeah, characters are great, but the format. THE FORMAT. I don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that I don't like that it's a play, because for fuck's sakes, IT'S A PLAY. Like, what did I expect? This may be the most confusing review I've ever written. I just don't like the play format. It's meant for the stage. That means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied. It's up to the audience to interpret nuances. It is almost entirely based on dialogue, and I hate that. I miss Rowling's writing. I love Rowling's writing, and I wanted more of it. The play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more, had it been expanded into a book format. The children's growing pains, particular that of young Albus. Harry's feelings as a parent. Draco's struggles with who he was and who he is. Furthermore, Ron is relegated to little more than comic relief. Let's be honest, I never liked the guy, but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude, and I know that Ron is more than that.I like it? I don't like it? I don't know. But I would certainly relish watching it on the stage if I ever had the chance. It's bound to be better than on paper.

(hide spoiler)]*sigh* The more I think about this the sadder I get...Original review:I'm not going to rate this right now because honestly I don't what to think about it. Reading this really felt like Harry Potter fan-fiction to me, partly because it's hard to wrap my head around an 8th (sort of) Harry Potter story and partly because reading it as a play instead of a novel just made it feel...less like Harry Potter. I didn't dislike it; I definitely didn't love it--but I do want to be fair and say that reading a play is never, never as good as seeing the live production. In theory maybe this book shouldn't exist because it won't ever do the story justice. However, I'm glad I got to read it because I don't think I'll ever get to London to see the real deal, and at least now I know what it's all about.

The plot is feasible, even if it felt a little forced, but the characters were just poor. The new ones aren’t so bad, but the old characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione, were barely themselves. They just had no depth to them; they’re like reflections of their surface level. Ron felt like a piece of furniture that seemed to enjoy inserting several badly times jokes. Hermione seemed cold. And Harry, Harry simply isn’t Harry. How can he identify himself as a bad farther? How can he believe that he had no farther figure in his own life? He had many. He had inspiration from many great men. They taught him a great deal about life and himself in the process. So why would a man who has defeated the face of evil be so daunted by giving his son some simple advice? It doesn’t add up. Harry Potter would make an excellent farther. This didn’t even feel like the same world.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________

This review contains *mild spoilers*.I've waited for this particular story for what feels like ages, and words cannot even describe for how grateful I am that it finally exists in my hands. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world that we all know and love.The story starts out at King's Cross with the original trio preparing their school-age children to board the train to start their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.It's at this time that Harry and his son, Albus, share a nice father-son moment:“Albus: Dad . . .Do you think — what if I am — what if I’m put in Slytherin . . .Harry: And what would be wrong with that?Albus: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It’s not a House of brave wizards.Harry: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”(I dislike Snape, but the overall conversation made me tear up a bit.)I also really appreciated that they talked about Slytherin in a positive light.We have a few time jumps here and there, and then complications arise because Harry - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - seized an illegal Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it.“The once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.”Meanwhile, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and struggles with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.Harry tries to reach out to Albus but finds that he has diffuclity understanding someone different. And their connection wobbles from year to year because of it.“Harry: Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which was . . . well, I know you don’t love it but . . .Albus: For you, it’s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .Harry: Albus, please — can we just —Albus: . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.Harry: I’m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.Albus: The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say — on behalf of wizarding kind — how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?Harry: Albus, please — you know, I’ve never wanted gratitude.Albus: But right now I’m overflowing with it — it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .Harry: Moldy blanket?Albus: What did you think would happen? We’d hug. I’d tell you I always loved you. What? What?Harry (finally losing his temper): You know what? I’m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you’ve got a dad. Because I didn’t, okay?Albus: And you think that was unlucky? I don’t.Harry: You wish me dead?Albus: No! I just wish you weren’t my dad.”Harry and Albus are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.The Cursed Child answered a lot of topics that had been left unanswered in my mind, and it makes my heart tighten just thinking about everything.“Harry: And I’ve locked away the map. You won’t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away — you know that? Wouldn’t let me go in — wouldn’t let anyone go in — you really scared her . . . And me.Albus: Really scared you?Harry: Yes.Albus: I thought Harry Potter wasn’t afraid of anything?Harry: Is that how I make you feel?Albus looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.ALBUS: I don’t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was better between us then either — so — the fact that I’m in Slytherin — that’s not the reason for our problems. It’s not just about that.”I really appreciated that their relationship was developed in a very honest and raw way.And not only theirs, but the development of Draco and his son, Scorpius, was truly melting my everything.“Draco: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.Harry: Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We’ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we’ve blighted their present.”Watching Draco care deeply and fiercely for his child made me open up my heart.Oh, and I wanted to mention how ecstatic I was when Albus befriended a Malfoy. Their friendship was inspiring until the very last heartbreaking page.“Scorpius: Your dad thinks the rumors are true — I am the son of Voldemort?Albus (nods): His department are currently investigating it.Scorpius: Good. Let them. Sometimes — sometimes I find myself thinking — maybe they’re true too.Albus: No. They’re not true. And I’ll tell you why. Because I don’t think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son — and you’re kind, Scorpius. To the depths of your belly, to the tips of your fingers. I truly believe Voldemort — Voldemort couldn’t have a child like you.Scorpius: That’s nice — that’s a nice thing to say.Albus: And it’s something I should have said a long time ago. In fact, you’re probably the best person I know. And you don’t — you couldn’t — hold me back. You make me stronger — and when Dad forced us apart — without you —Scorpius: I didn’t much like my life without you in it either.""We also had a lot of unexpected returns from the people that ended up sacrificing themselves in previous books, which truly broke me— I kept looking for Fred Weasley to show up and crack a joke... but, alas, you can't always get what you want. But to end this review on a more positive note, I want to mention my favorites: Hermione and Ron. “Ron: I mean, we’ve been together so long — and married for so long — I mean, so long —Hermione: If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.Ron: Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I’ve read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?Hermione (melting slightly): You want to marry me again?Ron: Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and — well, to be honest, I can’t remember much of it and . . . The truth is — I love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says — I’d like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.She looks at him, she smiles, she pulls him to her, she kisses him.Hermione: You’re sweet.Ron: And you taste of toffee . . .”I'm always up for more canon Romione.To sum up, I thought at first that the format of the story would interfere with getting completely pulled in, but I needn't have worried— this book was the definition of unputdownable. It truly didn't take long for me to realize how much I missed reading about Harry Potter and his magical surroundings. Hogwarts will always be like home. And now... I'm getting tearful just thinking about what an impact it made on me, as both the reader and person I am today.Also, it was pretty nice getting to know that both Harry Potter and I are afraid of pigeons:“Harry: You told me you don’t think I’m scared of anything, and that — I mean, I’m scared of everything. I mean, I’m afraid of the dark, did you know that?Albus: Harry Potter is afraid of the dark?Harry: I don’t like small spaces and — I’ve never told anyone this, but I don’t much like — (he hesitates before saying it) pigeons.Albus: You don’t like pigeons?Harry (he scrunches up his face): Nasty, pecky, dirty things. They give me the creeps.”Yes, Harry!!Oh, and my favorite acts were acts 2 & 4— because family dynamics and mystery!!Just... I'm so glad this book exists, I truly missed my favorite trio.5/5 stars (of course)*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsRULE FOR SPOILERS: if it's in the first 10%, and therefore (in most cases) available for scrutiny from undecided readers in the FREE downloadable preview, IT'S NOT A SPOILER.That being said, a LOT of things happen--IMPORTANT things--in the first five percent, let alone ten percent of HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD, so if you'd rather go into your read without significant prior knowledge, leave this review immediately.That's the only warning you're going to get.In my experience there are two types of hardcore fans for any given series:1. The Blind Zealot.This type of fan will forgive an author almost anything. Inconsistent behavior in main characters, enormous plot holes, unexplained developments, etc., it doesn't matter, b/c OHMAGAWD, I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! *squeeeeeeee*2. The Thoughtful, Critical Reader.This type of fan loves a series based solely on its merit. They aren't blind to the aforementioned plot holes or inconsistent characters, they are in fact disappointed by such occurrences, but they can still maintain LOVE for the overall series. For example, I LOVE HARRY POTTER, but I did not love HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, b/c I felt Rowling encapsulated all the teenangsty emotions of adolescence a little bit too thoroughly. It was, in a word, exhausting.PLOT TWIST: I think both types of fans are equally likely to have issues with this latest addition to their Harry Potter library.Blind Zealots:The trouble with ending a series is that if it's done well, you have all the answers to all of your questions, and a vague enough HEA-type scenario that your well-loved cast of characters is assured whatever it is that they deserve. Heroines and Heroes live happily ever after, Villains and Minions are thwarted and punished, and while you aren't foolish enough to think everyone's adventures are over, Good continuing to triumph over Evil is reasonably guaranteed. BUT.Once you've finished something, the only way to reopen it is too create new conflict--without conflict there's no story. Suddenly the nebulous ""HEA"" isn't so nebulous, and that new clarity jeopardizes everything you've happily assumed about what comes next.Harry, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron, previously cardboard cutouts of adult wizards, become real parents with real children, and those children must grow up, making mistakes while they do it, and, worse, they must go through puberty and all the angst that entails.That's not happily ever after . . . That's REAL LIFE. Then Real Life takes your daydream of a-son-of-Harry-Potter being sorted into Slytherin and reinventing the house's image with the kind of unaffected rebelliousness you associated with a teenaged Sirius Black, and crushes it under its heel, forcing you to realize that wizards . . . are kind of assholes.So now, adding insult to injury, the image of the utopian magical society that sprang fully formed from Voldemort's ashes is forever ruined.A Blind Zealot might find ignorance preferable to that turn of events.But those aren't my issues. My issues are thus:1. I HATE TIME TRAVEL.I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm an escapist reader. I need to be consumed by a book to fully enjoy it, and that means I NEED to be able to believe what I'm reading is the truth.BUT.Time travel destroys the possibility of believing anything, b/c it's ALL subject to change. Why mourn a character's death if it will more than likely be nullified in the next chapter or two? Why dredge up any outrage on a character's behalf when the object of her torment will be thwarted during the second take?For me, it's not an issue of, ""why would I?"" It's an issue of, ""I can't."" And if I can't feel anything in response to your characters or your story, why would I read your book?2. Resurrecting Voldemort-as-villain is lazy. And infuriating.We survived three of Voldemort's failed attempts at rebirth, we survived one success, and we survived a three book revelation that essentially said we had to kill him SEVEN TIMES for his death to actually stick.After all of that, how could anyone think it would be a Good Idea to bring him back AGAIN?Admittedly, it wasn't quite that simple, but . . . it was also exactly that simple. Everything and everyone else connected to ye olde grande scheme was superfluous, merely the means of achieving a so-very-tired end.As for the aforementioned superfluous detail: (view spoiler)[I recognize the futility of relying on Bellatrix LeStrange's marital status as an argument against her conceiving Voldemort's child. That crazy bitch was probably so euphoric at the idea of giving birth to her Master's spawn that she felt no pain during the actual delivery.BUT.No matter how much he wished it, Voldemort wasn't actually a god, so divine conception was an impossibility . . . Which means . . . He would have had to . . . Physically . . . Have . . . Sex . . . In order to produce offspring.O______OI don't think Bellatrix would've objected to the necessity--we've already established that she's a CRAZY BITCH.BUT . . . I'm not convinced he was physically able:A. At the alleged time of procreation, he was more snake than man. B. Snakes don't have noses, neither did Voldemort.C. Snakes don't have . . . do-NOT-make-me-say-it-you-know-where-this-is-going.That's all I'm sayin'. *shrugs awkwardly*  (hide spoiler)]3. Unnecessary drama.At first I debated whether or not it was fair to fault a staged production for being overly dramatic, but I hate unnecessary drama on the screen as much as I hate it on paper, so, YES, it most definitely is fair.A. Stop crying, dammit. Especially you, Harry. *rolls eyes*B. Ginny's instant escalation from concerned-but-understanding wife into finger-pointing harridan. If you've read it, you know to what I'm referring.C. Harry's impersonation of a father-as-dictator (view spoiler)[that I initially attributed to the first timeturning, but as he had his come-to-Jesus before the timeline was altered again, I'm forced to conclude was simply his epically poor parenting skills. (hide spoiler)]4. Contradictions, including, but not limited to:In Act 2, when Harry uses his conversation with Dumbledore-as-portrait as reasoning for his ludicrous request, Headmistress McGonagoll admonishes him for treating a ""memoir"" like the actual person:
HARRY: And Dumbledore—Dumbledore said—PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: What? HARRY: His portrait. We spoke. He said some things which made sense—PROFESSOR McGONAGALL: Dumbledore is dead, Harry. And I’ve told you before, portraits don’t represent even half of their subjects.
BUT, in Act 4, this:DUMBLEDORE (openly weeping now): I was blind. That is what love does. I couldn’t see that you needed to hear that this closed-up, tricky, dangerous old man . . . loved you. A pause. The two men are overcome with emotion.
Either they're two men or they're one man and a flawed copy. Pick one and stick with it, please.5. Plot holes.A. If Dolores Umbrage warded her Hogwarts office against unauthorized entry, do you really expect me to believe that (view spoiler)[Hermione wouldn't similarly ward the office of the MINISTER OF MAGIC? (hide spoiler)]B. How many times have we heard some variation of, ""Am I the only person who's read Hogwarts, a History?""And how many of those times were specifically in reference to wards that prevented witches and wizards from magicking themselves onto Hogwarts' property? Yet suddenly and inexplicably, anyone can use the floo network to travel to any number of chimneys on the grounds.C. There was also some nonsense about Albus and Scorpius not needing to worry about a certain de-wanded Hogwarts student being harmed b/c ""the professors would never allow serious injury to occur,"" which is, simply put . . . laughable.That's not to say HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD was horrible and I hated it. It wasn't and I didn't. I even loved parts of it, Scorpius in particular. BUT. Even taking into consideration that it was a script, not a novel, it wasn't the same level of quality we've come to expect from Rowling (who, no, may not have written the thing in its entirety, but who, YES, did collaborate on and ultimately give her seal of approval for), and that is disappointing. I'm not going to bother recommending or not recommending this one--you'll either read it or you won't, and at this stage of series worship or indifference, your decision will have little to do with what I have to say about it. SO. Go forth and do what you were always going to do.

Bloody Hell!I freaking cried. I was afraid I wasn't going to like this book but I did and I damn cried. This is a SPOILER FREE review so I can't tell you what made me cry. Even though this is about the kids and all of our loves are older, they wrote the book in a way that we get to have some memories of certain things. And my favorite character made me cry again! I really hope they put this play out on dvd sometime and make it available to everyone. Although, it might be weird seeing other people playing the parts. Anyway, I loved reading about the children. I loved the friendship between Albus, Harry's son and Scorpius, Draco's son. Scorpius was the sweetest one of all, who would have thunk. I didn't like some of the parts Ron played, he seemed like an idiot but he's Ron and I love Ron. Of course most of you already know it's written in a play format. This was weird at first and then I got into it. I don't think I have ever read a play before, it seems like I would remember. This was a nice little trip down Hogwarts Lane and the little mystery/hijinks the kids get up to that brings on all kinds of issues was a cool edition. Well, not really, but you know what I mean. I loved it. I can't say that I loved everything about it and I might not have loved it if that one part didn't come into play, but who cares. I am so happy with it for what it is. I hope you all love it as much as I did and if you don't then that's okay too. 
Thank you for being my light in the darkness

A 'Play', of friendship, courage & anti-prejudice as before..ANDMarital relations, Father/Son issues.A new Story goes farther than ever..travelling back & forth in time..Then back to where it all began..To close the circle.Once & for all.
HARRY: 
The Boy Who Lived. How many people have to die for the Boy Who Lived?
A Bittersweet ending to The Saga of The Boy Who Lived.Our Friends are different a little bit here than we knew them?YES, I mean who isn't? It's 19 years later.. Are you now as you'd expected would be 10 years ago? Are your real life friends still the same 12, 15 years later?The Story is in Different form & atmosphere? YES., It's a Play..screen play - and not to mention that there's a ‘Definitive Edition’ of the play as it is just the Rehearsal Edition.. Not the Trio story rather the children's? YES. It's story of 19 years later...of the new generation..So STOP Moaning like Myrtle,It's still very faithful to the magical series..A perfect conclusion to the Symmetry* of the Epic series in the History.~~~~~~~~~~Since the Ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows we wanted more...One more time.Many asking too many ""What If""..What if Harry's son end up in Slytherin?What if Ron and Hermione didn't work out as the author herself suspects?What if there's a Time Turner left?What if we use it to save someone of Death?What if we use it to save Voldemort? or to make more Horcrux ? Or worst? What if we had One More Book? Nineteenth Years Later?**The Play**--------First of all, Please do a Worldwide tour...Please include Egypt.It's easy to read, and to get into the story..Alas, I have to admit that being in form of ‘play’ and not a novel made it even a bit “dry” like most Fan Fictions., I even thought, after spending a direct 6 hours reading 3 Acts that it may be one and not the real deal -since I read it first in ebook format till my hard copy arrive to Egypt- Anyway, You have to use your imagination to get the scenes...recall your past experience, life in Hogwarts and you'll be easily in...Reliving the MagicAdd to being a play, it's not all by J.K. Rowling, the story is by her, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany together..And the Playwright is by Jack Thorne...not Rowling.Yet the lines are really fun, smart..just amazing.And you have to let go once you start ‘Act Two’ cause everything starts to heat up much..in a very fast packed adventure, and theatrical dramatic ones…The Story--------“Can you Keep the Secret?”Will try my best.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It's different... more mature...real wild and dangerous cause it deals with the most dangerous Instruments...TIME..This time you'd feel that Rowling is really cruel to the characters..It may be about the Test of Life....To Choose between what's good and what's easy..BUT it was real hard test to us all..I will merely summing up only Act One..It starts right with the “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” Epilogue scene..Albus Severus Potter is worried sick he'd end up in SlythrineYet.. as soon as he started his year, this was the least of his troubles.Surprisingly befriended with Scorpius Malfoy, surprisingly hates Hogwarts…Surprisingly hates being the child of The Boy Who Lived, while many died in his cause.The Father/Son issue in its worst..And before his fourth year starts..Everything happens fast…Harry as Ministry official and Hermione as Minister for Magic seize an illegal last Time Turner..that even more dangerous..Amos Diggory wants his son back...who had been killed by Voldmort in the Triwizard Tournament more than 20 years ago..Albus feels his father's responsible for this death..An attempt to change a minor misfortune of the past leads into a massive , colossal damage to the present and the future..And even turns into a horrible Dystopia.It's like The Butterfly Effect… Days of Future PastAgain it's a story of the value of Friendship… The wrong of Prejudice... But it's also about Father/Son relation very well written..I loved how it goes, from wrong to kinda right.Between Harry and Albus, Between Dumbledore and Harry…And even between Draco and Scorpius..Also the Marital relation is really good here…I loved Ron and Hermione their opposite character yet their strong bond.And the love that lived...between Harry and Ginny.Oh and Draco and his wife…Okay, time for,The Characters-----------Again... Rowling is really cruel to her characters here..Harry's being a ""Hot Head"" is clearly deepening the problem with his son.. he's always has been a hot head by the way..yet Ginny is a good mother, and better wife than I expected.Hermone was good , not excellent but I LOVED how she turned into two different characters .. one was really awesome in the Dystopia, the second was really bad...but that may match what happened.I just may be didn't like Ron much that I didn't feel angry enough for him being a bit shallow in this play but that still a bit sad.And I have to admit that I really LOVE how Draco is...with his still being have the trace of what he was before...BUT don't forget it's not about Harry Potter anymore...it's more about the Kids...Though I wished to see more of Rose who's been shallow but I just loved Albus and Scorpios..You'll be surprised with who you're gonna meet here.. truly.Some of the Characters we all love makes appearance, some of them even you may never expect to see again!!!! I have to say that I felt goosebumps everytime an old character appears...not just flashbacks, some was in The Future Past, or a real dystopia, some in dreams, even in portraits and some are just mentioned.I really loved it. And wished for even more.I was so sad for the death of some, and the re-death of some..And just remember ... when you're 40.. you don't live the adventures much as your children..And this last story is about them after all....The Children..Who's The Cursed Child-------------------As if I'm gonna tell, ha!Till the mid of the third act you'll have many suspicious.In Harry Potter’s dreams here he can be The Cursed Child...-one of the best haunting scenes in every early novels was always Harry’s dreams, I bet it's purely written by Rowling here-oh and looking from The Dursleys perspective, he is..even worse, he's so in his Son's eyes as well…And that's what triggers everything here.Many surprises, many twists…I loved it… I loved the ending as well…Playing in time is dangerous and as every one since the last book asked about Why Not Using the Time Turner….here's the answer..in the last book of the Series that changed the History forever..Letting Go.------------By the end of this book you'll realize why J.K. Rowling announced that that's it for Harry Potter stories… it is the the full circle… the Beginning meets the End..the time has answered every What-if we can think of.What if we use the time Turner to...It's all here.19 Years for most of us, since the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in 1997...Reading the story of Harry and his friends in 7 Volumes..Reading as many lines about the back story of them and the rest of characters in the Pottermore and social media by Rowling. Craving for one more time with them...after the Epilogue that passed 19 years.Get excited with the very short article 2 years ago on Dumbledore Army reunited in the Qudditch World Cup.Now here it is, a full story, one last story full of love and nostalgia.We can't go back in time. We shan't dwell in the past..And when I finish it, 2 times, I really admit This is EVERYTHING I've ever wanted in a Harry Potter sequels but I just wish a Time Turner, back to 1997 and start reading Harry Potter all over again.... :)It's not good to dwell in past anyway, so I'm just Happy I lived this series..grown up with it..I, and many of Potterheads and fans, were worried sick it may let us down but I'm so glad that many liked it.And it's bittersweet to know that's it.BUT We must have THE ‘Definitive Edition’ of the play that promised.The series of Harry Potter, the boy who lived,is now complete…And we still have a Wizarding World so vast to explore.With J.K. Rowling, our Queen of Magic.Mohammed ArabeyFrom 31 July 2016To 1 Aug. 2016**“ The Symmetry in case you didn't notice it yet.”And you can really add more similarities to that .This time it's so related to the Heart of the Series,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which is heavily echoes here..If you agree about the symmetrical relation specially between this one and Goblet of Fire, let's discuss it at the comments :)

Might do a video review so I can go more into depth because I definitely have more to say.

FULL VIDEO REVIEW IS LIVE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNTYG...I have a lot of mixed feelings on this book. Am I happy we got another Harry Potter story? Yes. Am I satisfied with some aspects? Absolutely. But am I disappointed as well? Unfortunately, YES.L I K E S :Characters:I was so happy to feel like the characters were authentic. Throughout the entire novel, these felt like the children I grew up alongside and their development over the last two decades into adults felt REAL. Everyone was who I wanted them to become (ESPECIALLY DRACO) and even the kid's had their own distinctive voices I really enjoyed. The dynamic of the characters (Harry & Draco are a perfect example, as well as Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione) were consistent with the books, yet still developed over the years into what I felt they should be. Also Scorpius is my everything, he is one of the purest characters in all of literature and if you disagree, bye.Things that were addressed that needed to be addressed:(view spoiler)[.FINALLY WE SEE HARRY SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF HIS CHILDHOOD. It bothered me to no end that in the books, the only remnants of his abuse were Harry being surprised when people were nice to him. Here, Harry is obviously suffering from flashbacks from life with the Dursley's and as much as I hate to see him in further pain, I've been wondering for years why this never came up before. Consider me satisfied.  (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)[ HARRY CONFRONTS DUMBLEDORE ABOUT KEEPING HIM THE DARK ABOUT ALL HE KNEW. Let me start off by saying I LOVE Albus Dumbledore. He made mistakes over the years in how he approached Harry/Voldemort and what not, but overall, I think he was a great man, a talented wizard, and had a good heart despite his questionable actions. That being said, Harry did gain more nerve over the years as he was growing up, and his mini-heated moments with Dumbledore never really did the situation justice in my opinion. I'm so happy Harry finally called Dumbledore out on how little information he shared with Harry and Dumbledore was forced to respond. I really really loved this scene and I'm so glad it finally happened.  (hide spoiler)]Minimal moments that made me happy: Basically, I think there are so many people that loved everything about this book, but as I read this book very critically and found a lot of faults, the parts I loved seemed pretty minimal so I've grouped them here.-Beginning: I loved that the story started at the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. I didn't even think this was a possibility, but I think it was the perfect way to mesh these two stories into one another.- Draco & Harry's Dynamic: These two developed exactly as I wanted them to. While there is still an air of distaste around both of them, they've truly grown and come to terms with each other. (view spoiler)[ We have classic Draco/Harry like the duel in Harry's kitchen, the fact that Draco still refers to Harry as Potter, and especially that wonderful line ""Keep up old man."" ""Draco, we're the same age. ""Well, I wear it better."" But we also have beautiful moments like when Draco admits he was always jealous of The Golden Trio or really opens up to Harry about Astoria & wanting to protect Scorpius. It was truly one of my favorite relationships in the book and I'm ecstatic it turned out the way I wanted it to.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ The transition of the timeline changing was done REEAAAALLLY well. When Harry tells Albus he has to spend all of his time in the Gryffindor common room and claims ""he knows what house he is"", I was truly confused being like ""Harry Potter are you even trying to change the housing system? You're not THAT famous."" but I very quickly realized it was the timeline slowing changing everyone but Albus/Scorpius and I thought it was a clever way to set up for the next scene of UTTER CHAOS.  (hide spoiler)]-(view spoiler)[ Albus's idea to write a message to Harry in demiguise to react with the love potion he spilled on Harry's blanket was BRILLIANT in my opinion. While I'm still questioning how they got a hold of the blanket so easily without Lily knowing, it was a very classic HP Solution moment to me, and I was super satisfied.  (hide spoiler)]Humor: I personally really enjoyed the humor in the play! The jokes coming from the cast felt really true to their characters and this book had me laughing out loud all throughout the books. I'll go over specific lines in my video review for the sake of length on here, but I don't think there was a single intentional joke that didn't have me howling of laughter.Scorpius & Albus: Okay listen, I am one to respect anyone's sexuality, so if these two claim they're straight, they're straight. But seriously, there is so much queer baiting in this script that it pains me to know it was never going to amount to anything. I don't understand why it's so bad to have two gay wizards as the main characters. If you're going to throw lines at me like ""He doesn't like his friend talking to a girl"" and ""They hug each other with fierceness. They hold for a beat."" IMMA SHIP THEM TOGETHER. And that's not to undermine their love as friends; regardless of their sexuality, they have a beautiful relationship and their dynamic is a pleasure to read. It's clear they love each other so much, even if it is just as friends. I just think I would have loved this story on a whole 'nother level if their friendship became something more at the end of the story.D I S L I K E S :Lack of characters: This goes into my feeling that this plot was FAR TOO LARGE to be limited to the time constraints and physical space on the stage for a play. There is an absence of every character who is not Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Albus, Scorpius,and Delphi. -Hugo: Does not appear ONCE. What REALLY confuses me and goes into the contradiction to the books, is that he was at Kings Cross in the Deathly Hallows epilogue, yet he's not in the first scene. He starts Hogwarts during Albus/Scorpius/Rose's third year, yet he. is. never. there. He's Ron and Hermione's child for gods sake! He should have been in this book!- Rose, James, & Lily: While we do see these three in the beginning for a few scenes, all three are virtually absent from the entire play after about Act Two. How on earth do you expect me to believe these two groups of parents are off on another CRAZY adventure, but don't show any thought about their children, other than Albus? It's just unreasonable and does not make sense. I'm going to say this a million times throughout these reviews, but if you use the argument that ""it's a play, they don't have enough time,"" then they should not have made this story a play. Lack of room for a plot is the biggest reason to NOT include it and putting out something incomplete is just sloppy and amateur.- Neville: Neville is mentioned COUNTLESS times throughout this novel. He's a professor at Hogwarts and you bet your ass he would coddle The Golden Trio's children like they were his own, but again HE DOESN'T SHOW UP ONCE. (view spoiler)[ I mean the world literally ""rests of Neville Longbottom"" at on point, and we still don't see his as an active part of the play?  (hide spoiler)] I'm purely disappointed.- Teddy Lupin: Teddy is obviously a very minor character but HE WAS ALSO AT KINGS CROSS (which still confuses me because he had left Hogwarts at this point, but whatevs) HE WAS STILL THERE. They made a big deal that Teddy was a ""part of the Potter family"" and came over for dinner frequently, but he isn't even mentioned in the books. Also, his CHARACTER ITSELF was made a big deal by Jo, who wanted the story to end on another child being left an orphan. But nope, there's no space for anyone who wasn't a main character (which is a large fault in the author's planning because side characters are still hugely important to a story) so we don't see him at all.- Hagrid: OK WHERE THE HELL IS HAGRID. Someone suggested to me that he may have wrongfully passed, but if McGonagall is alive, I'm betting Hagrid's giant blood gives him a different lifespan than most wizards. HE WOULD LITERALLY DO ANYTHING TO SPEND TIME WITH HARRY&GINNY&RON&HERMIONE'S CHILDREN WHERE IS HE. We go through like three or four alternate timelines of Hogwarts and he is absent in all of them. Seriously, it's a straight up disservice to his character.Harry & Albus's relationship: (view spoiler)[ I really disliked how Albus treated his father. People are on here saying Harry is a terrible father, and all I can think is why none of them touch on how terrible of a son Albus was in the beginning. Albus is so angsty and resentful that his father is famous (most of which, he didn't chose to be famous for) and completely denies any effort Harry makes. Albus MOCKS HARRY OF HIS CHILDHOOD AND ABUSE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! He makes fun of Harry for being an orphan (not his fault) and being abused by the Dursley's (not his fault.) Yes, Harry's response was not okay either. But we have YEARS of Harry attempting to help Albus and connect with him that fall to pieces with one comment. We also have years of Albus treating Harry like shit. It took me a really long time to like Albus because of this, and I'm glad the ending implies that they are finally starting to connect with each other and build a better relationship, the beginning of this novel was painful to read because of it.  (hide spoiler)]The scene in the Ministry: okay I got a looooooot of issues here. 1. (view spoiler)[ Hermione, the goddamn Minister of Magic, would allow her office to be opened with a simple ""Alohomora""? Preposterous.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ THIS WHOLE BOOKCASE PLOT IS SO STUPID. Why on earth would she leave a trail of riddles leading to the time turner if A. No one but herself and select Ministry employees are meant to know about it. B. WHY WOULD THE RIDDLES ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE DAMN TIME TURNER!? In previous HP riddles (i.e. Sorcerer's Stone & Goblet of Fire), the riddles are meant to be tests to prove if you are worthy enough to move on. The riddles here are meant as ""protection"", yet it doesn't protect them at all, it literally leads anyone who could figure it out RIGHT TO WHAT SHE WAS HIDING. Hermione knows where she hid it, she wouldn't need to go through the same scavenger hunt over and over again when she wants to retrieve it. The protection should have made it IMPOSSIBLE for anyone unwanted to find it. I despise the idea that the brightest witch of her age and the most (politically) powerful witch in Britian would so poorly protect a highly dangerous and illegal object.  (hide spoiler)]THE TIME TURNERS:Oh lordy, lordy. Prepare for the longest rant of this entire review. 1. To give you a run down, the system of time travel established in Prisoner of Azkaban is essentially a ""fixed timeline"" meaning that the time traveler's actions would not alter the timeline at all. (ex. it's Harry who creates the Patronus to save himself & Sirius because as Harry himself claims ""It was easy, because I'd already done it.) In Harry Potter & The Cursed Child, it follows the timeline known as the ""Grandfather Paradox"" (aka used in Back to the Future) which is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEM OF TIME that is more flexible and allows people to change history by their actions. YOU. CAN'T. HAVE. TWO. DIFFERENT. SYSTEMS. OF. TIME. It's made clear that creating a paradox is possible in POA (an example given is that one can kill their future/past self if they are recognized by themselves), but that doesn't change that fact that there is no evidence of the fixed timeline that has been established for 12 years in TCC. Paradoxes fucking everywhere and The Doctor is sobbing from his Tardis.2. (view spoiler)[ It's stated in this book that the time turner Albus & Scorpius use DOES allow them to go back further than hours. (If you didn't know, time turners are virtually an encased HOUR reversal charm. Using a regular time turner, Albus, Scorpius, and Delphi would have had to turn the object over 200,000 times to go back to the TriWizard Tournament.) Since it's established that it's different, we are never told how it actually works? Do we still twist it back to choose how far we want? Is it a yearly-reversal charm now? (which also doesn't make sense, see point #3) You can't introduce an entirely new magical object without giving any explanation. If Prisoner of Azkaban can teach us about time turners in a 2 1/2 hour movie, The Cursed Child could explain how this new one works in a 3 hour play. There's literally no excuse for this gigantic piece of missing information. And again, if you think ""they didn't have enough time in the play to explain it,"" IT. SHOULD. NOT. BE. INCLUDED.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ Since when do time turners allow you to pick the exact date & time you want to arrive in time at???????? They travel back to tasks #1 and #2 of the TriWizard tournament at LEAST twice over the course of MULTIPLE days, meaning they don't need to be on the exact date they want to travel 23 years back. They somehow have the ability to pick the DAY, YEAR, AND TIME they want to travel to with ZERO explanation. For a prototype, that's pretty extensive, and most likely, IMPOSSIBLE.  (hide spoiler)]4. On Pottermore, (here's an image as a source https://twitter.com/LIBassBunny/statu... - the original post I found it from is from 3 years ago) J.K. Rowling admits that she left a ton of plot holes in the system of time travel she created. She claims to have fixed that over the years, ending the solution with destroying all of them during the battle at the Department of Mysteries. And I think this is great, this is what authors should have the incentive to do when they make a mistake. BUT if she wanted to fix it, why would she approve a script that is built on the foundation of something she tried to erase in her books? It truly makes me question either how genuine her approval is, or the integrity of her character to turn her back on her previous decisions.To sum up, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child BUTCHERED the system of time & time travel created by Jo and I have no words to describe how detrimental this is to the plot.Big secret plot twist I don't want to spoil: (view spoiler)[ BELLATRIX WAS PREGNANT WITH VOLDEMORT'S CHILD, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?? THIS IS RIDICULOUS. 1. Not only is it upsetting to me because I always imagined Voldemort to be asexual in a sense because human emotions other than hatred, like love and happiness and lust always seemed so beneath him (Yes, lust is a human emotion, for the most part. Humans and other mammals are virtually the only species that have sex for pleasure and not strictly procreation.) So first of all, I'm amazed Voldemort having sex is even canon.  (hide spoiler)]2. (view spoiler)[ We see Bellatrix Lestrange throughout her pregnancy during the books, despite her never being pregnant???? I'm gonna assume here that wizard pregnancy is the same as muggle pregnancy and she would carry her child for 9 months. In Deathly Hallows, we see Belltrix at the beginning of the book (July 1997) at Malfoy Manor, and later we see her at Malfoy Manor after Harry breaks into Gringotts (May 1998). She is not pregnant in the books at either of these times. Yes, that's 11 months and she CONVENIENTLY could have brought her pregnancy to term within those 11 months we don't see her. But when something is this conveniently timed after the fact, it destroys all evidence to realism to me.  (hide spoiler)]3. (view spoiler)[ With the Malfoy Manor being basically Death Eater HQ at this time, I'd like to think Bellatrix spent a lot of time there surrounded by Death Eaters. ARE YOU TELLING ME NO ONE NOTICED SHE WAS FUCKING PREGNANT?! I guess we apparently now have a spell to reduce a baby bump or some other convenient explanation here.  (hide spoiler)]4. (view spoiler)[ To go along with #3, Draco LIVES at Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix was definitely there multiple times over the 11 months. Bellatrix is his aunt, whom I would assume he would see more than other Death Eaters considering she and her mother always seemed relatively close. Are you trying to tell me one of the main characters from this story would just ""happen"" to not see/forget his aunt's pregnancy happening in his own home, right under his nose?  (hide spoiler)]This is ridiculous. This is far too convenient. There is too little information on when this actually happened. I refuse to accept this as part of the plot.Random little things that bother me:- First trip back in time: (view spoiler)[ Albus asks if they're certain the dragon won't kill Cedric without his wand, Delphi replies ""This is Hogwarts. They won't let damage happen to any of the champions."" YOU REALIZE YOU ARE THERE BECAUSE A BOY ACTUALLY DIED IN THIS COMPETITION AND YOU ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT. YOU ARE LITERALLY IN 1994 STANDING WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE A CHAMPION DIED. LIKE WHO LET THIS LINE PASS THROUGH EDITING!?!?!  (hide spoiler)]-The Trolley Witch: (view spoiler)[ Okay serious what was this nonsense. Absolutely ridiculous. I have no idea who's executive decision this was, but it was terrible. This is the wizarding world. We could have had a much better and fitting obstacle to prevent Albus & Scorpius from jumping off the train. I couldn't even laugh at it's ridiculousness because I was cringing too hard.  (hide spoiler)]T H I N G S T H A T M A D E M E C R Y :-Harry in Godric's Hollow: (view spoiler)[ I have seen the deaths of Lily and James Potter quite a few times throughout the series, but nothing compares to the pain of watching Harry have to watch. As much as this hurt me, I think it was a wonderful addition to the play.  (hide spoiler)]-Hagrid meeting Harry for the first time: (view spoiler)[ ""My name is Rubeus Hagrid, and I'm going to be your friend whether you like it or not."" Tears. No explanation neeed.  (hide spoiler)]-Draco opening up to Harry: (view spoiler)[ When Draco visits Harry at work and they talk about their sons, Astoria's death, and Draco's life, I was a mess. ""It is exceptionally lonely being Draco Malfoy"" hit me SOOO hard. I also love how much Draco loves Astoria and Scorpius. I just thought this scene was so deep and true and I'm forever grateful we got to see it.  (hide spoiler)]There are a million more things to say in my video review, so stay tuned for that on my YouTube channel. All in all, I'm happy we got this book. I'm happy I read it. I'm happy that some things stayed true and somethings impressed me. But I'm super disappointed that it's so dissociated from the rest of the books plot-wise and that it was very underdeveloped. I will stand by my opinion that this should have been a full novelization of the play, and that would have fixed a lot of the inconsistencies and plot holes. I will absolutely go to see this play when it hits New York, and I would recommend it to any Harry Potter fan.

Don’t read this if you haven’t read the Harry Potter series and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yet!-------------------------------------If you loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I wouldn’t recommend reading my review. This is going to be a rant! You’ve been warned!-------------------------------------This is the very first time I have rated a book one stars! Believe me, I don’t want to do this, but I really didn’t enjoy reading Cursed Child. Before I get started, I want you to know the following: 1. A couple of weeks ago, I read some spoilers from people who had watched the play. Those immediately lowered my expectations. I knew going into this I wasn’t going to like it. 2. I knew this was not written by J.K. Rowling. 3. I knew this wasn’t the eight book, but the script for the play.I love the Harry Potter series so much. And I always will. It means a lot to me and when I heard about this, I immediately pre-ordered it. I’ve seen some people say ‘it’s Harry Potter so obviously I love this’, but I can’t say the same. Call me critical but I spent money on this. People spend money on tickets to go see the play. I expect something decent in return then.To call this fanfiction is an insult to all the people who try to bring more joy to a fandom. The Cursed Child was just plain bad writing. I will get into detail later, but I refuse to accept what happened as canon. I don’t care what J.K. Rowling says. This is a disgrace to the characters and the people who loved the original book series. You might think that I’m taking this too seriously, but they shouldn’t ask money for this if it were ‘just for fun’. This is literally being promoted as ‘the eight story’ in the Harry Potter series. I knew before I started it that it wasn’t, but the marketing team pretends it is.So no, I won’t apologise for being critical. Just because this isn’t a book, but a play, doesn’t mean that the story shouldn’t be as good. In fact, that is such an insult to plays! It’s just another form of media. I’ve seen some people say: “You can’t judge this if you haven’t seen the play”. Well, if that’s the case, they shouldn’t have published it as a book. I can’t afford going to London and paying a lot of money in order for some people to validate my opinion.Let’s start of with the things I did like:This felt as if I was reading a book. It didn’t take time to adjust to the format. I’m also curious to see what everything is going to look like in the actual play. But, since I really don’t like the actual story and what they did to the characters, I’m not sure yet whether I’d be willing to pay money for that.Out of all the characters, Hermione was the only one who still resembled who she used to be. I’m proud that she has become Minister for Magic! I also really liked Minerva! And Draco proved he was a good parent (much better than Harry…).I enjoyed the interactions between Albus and Scorpius! They’re such good ‘friends’ (A.K.A. boyfriends).That was it. Those were the only thing I like. My list of dislikes is much longer! I had six full pages of notes. When I read a book that’s over a thousand pages long, I don’t even have that many notes! Let’s get started:The plot is basically 90% about trying to bring back Cedric Diggory. I don’t understand why Albus is so obsessed with Cedric. So many people died for Harry, why does it have to be Cedric? Obviously because Amos asked, but to have almost the entire plot of this play resolve around that…I’d rather read every single second of a class taught at Hogwarts! Because this wasn’t magical enough. Sure, it features the characters we know and love and Hogwarts, but we rarely get to see actual magic. When Albus, Delphi and Scorpius are searching for the Time Turner in Hermione’s office, they don’t even try ‘accio’! Instead, they search the entire bookcase! Whenever we do get some magic, it isn’t explained enough. Why couldn’t Delphi use ‘imperio’ on Albus? She said: “to fulfil the prophecy […] Imperio just won’t do”. Why not? Or when Harry transfigured into Voldemort… Is that even possible? Why would wizards go through the trouble of brewing polyjuice potion then? All of this is just very convenient, but didn’t make enough sense.One of the things that bothered me most, was Ron Weasley’s characterisation. He has become a caricature of the person he used to be. The only reason he’s there, is for comic relief. All he does is eat and make stupid jokes. They act as if he’s so dumb and doesn’t take anything serious. Did Thorne actually read the original series before he wrote this? Because this is not the Ron I know! I refuse to believe that he was so drunk at his own wedding he doesn’t remember anything. And why would Ron give someone love potion? He had a terrible experience with it when he was a teenager, why in the world would he do that? It doesn’t make any sense!Another character who was completely butchered was Cedric Diggory. In the alternate universe where he lost the Triwizard Tournament, he becomes a death-eater and kills Neville. Cedric was one of the kindest characters. It’s absurd to assume that he would become a racist murderer just because he got humiliated!Scorpius said: “Cedric was a different person entirely – dark, dangerous”. We only found out that he killed Neville, but Scorpius didn’t interact with him. I don’t understand where this observation comes from. And I had that feeling quite a few times while reading this; as if I had skipped a couple of pages without realising it.Harry Potter is a terrible father. I didn’t like him once in this ‘book’. Granted, Albus is a whiny teenager: he has no idea how privileged he is. Don’t tell me he doesn’t get special treatment because he’s a Potter. A lot of people have it worse than him. Still, Harry had no right to say the things he did. And his excuse? He didn’t have a father figure growing up. He had plenty! What about Arthur, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid and even Dumbledore, Harry?! Harry had no right to attack Minerva either. Just because a woman doesn’t have children, doesn’t mean she isn’t able to take care of them. She’d be a much better parent than he ever was.And when did he become a psychic? His scar hurts, he actually hears Voldemort’s voice and can speak Parseltongue again, but Delphi hadn’t even saved Voldemort yet (actually, she never does). How is he able to do that if nothing has changed? Voldemort wasn’t back, yet he acted as if he was? Once again, I just don’t understand…Also, what is up with Lily’s blanket? I don’t remember him ever talking about it in the books, yet now Harry pretends as if it’s his most precious possession in the entire world. I know he didn’t possess it in the other books, but it’s still strange that he’s so obsessed with it now.Oh, and the special privileges? Harry is at Hogwarts all the damn time! I don’t remember parents being allowed there. I guess being a Potter does mean you’re allowed to do more than others.A lot of people hate Severus Snape and don’t see him as a brave person. While I don’t feel as strongly about that as them, I completely understand why they feel that was. He was horrible to his pupils, particularly Hermione, Harry and Neville. But, in the alternative universe, Hermione and Ron secretly work together with him. He used to be so mean to them, it seems highly unlikely to me they would forgive him! Just because he didn’t turn out to be a death-eater, doesn’t mean it justifies his behaviour. Snape’s interactions with Scorpius were so cringe-worthy. He isn’t a nice guy who makes one or two jokes and he’d never talk that openly about Lily.Because so many characters felt differently, I didn’t care about them anymore. When Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves and received the dementor’s kiss, I felt nothing. On the one hand, I’m sad we didn’t get to see Sirius, Remus, Tonks an Teddy. But on the other hand, I’m very glad, since their characters would have been butchered as well!This book almost pretends as if the other Potter and Granger-Weasley kids don’t exist. Ever heard of Hugo???The timeline is so strange. Page 22 and a year has past. Page 27 and they’re already starting their third year at Hogwarts. Seven pages later, another year has past! Surely, they could have given us a glimpse at their lives at Hogwarts without having to do it like this. Later on, Scorpius and Albus are in Scotland, without any brooms or wands. Yet the very next page, they’re already in Godric’s Hollow! How is that even possible? Again, this is not explained.And how did Albus and Scorpius know every single detail from what went down over twenty years ago at the Triwizard Tournament and Battle of Hogwarts? Did their parents tell them literally everything? Were very detailed books written? I need to know this!In the alternate universe, they kept mentioning an ‘Augurey’ and I had no idea what it meant. It’s only explained many scenes later. I cannot stress enough how underdeveloped some plots were. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on because things weren’t explained well enough. And that causes plot holes.I’m so thankful they didn’t use the Time Turner often in the Harry Potter series. I can already imagine how how things would have ended otherwise: Harry would have gone back in time and kill Voldemort and save James and Lily. Whenever a universe has the ability to time travel, that’s the kind of things that happen. It’s predictable. Yet that’s exactly what Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is about. They go back in time over FOUR TIMES just to go back to how things were at the beginning of the play. It’s such a waste of time. I can think of so many plots that would have been more interesting. Imagine there’s ever going to be a F.R.I.E.N.D.S movie and it turns out Monica has left Chandler and never wants to see her children again. That wouldn’t make any sense at all. But that is how Cursed Child feels like to me.Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books an films, so I obviously have no problems with time travelling. But this was just too much.As I’ve mentioned before, I really missed the magic. And of course the characters, because Cursed Child completely butchered them. Think of how much better this would be if it was about one school year at Hogwarts, without Voldemort trying to kill everyone. Just one year of the adventures Scorpius and Albus encounter. There didn’t need to be this much family drama. Honestly, I’m pretty sure this was the script of a Days of Our Lives or The Bold and the Beautiful episode instead! Just think how they could have explored the other houses, besides Gryffindor! But no, in Cursed Child, everyone is still prejudiced towards Slytherins and they pretend Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don’t even exist!This is only about three hundred pages long, yet it was so repetitive. Scorpius and Albus do something stupid; Draco, Harry and Ginny run after them and need Hermione because “their children are missing!” AGAIN!I also had some problems with the writing itself: Voldemort Day? ‘Oh Potter’ instead of ‘Oh Shit’? Mudbloods in the dungeons? The Blood Ball? WE GET IT, VOLDEMORT IS BACK! “A Malfoy who may be a Voldemort” Euhm, that’s just awful writing. ‘Voldemort’ isn’t a last name; it’s not as if ‘Lord’ was his first name. It should have been ‘Riddle’ instead. ‘Thank Dumbledore’ instead of ‘Thank God’ is not only cheesy, it is also incredibly arrogant. I’m not the most religious person but to say that Dumbledore is a God… It’s so sexist that at the Triwizard Tournament, every school got a lot of cheers besides Beauxbatons! I know boys also attend it, but it’s still more ‘feminine’ than Durmstrang or Hogwarts.Almost everyone who has read this, can’t deny there is something going on between Albus and Scorpius. They are so gay! But of course, this book is heteronormative to the max! I can already hear J.K. Rowling in a couple of years: “Actually, they were dating, but it wasn’t important to the story”. Please don’t give this woman any praise when it comes to diversity, she doesn’t deserve it. The Cursed Child could have meant a great deal more if they weren’t so afraid to include characters who aren’t straight for a change. And don’t even get me started on Albus’ crush on Delphi. He’s like fourteen and she was twenty? That’s disgusting.Which brings me to Delphi, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Do you really expect me to believe that Voldemort was capable of love and lust? Why do they feel the need to establish that every character is ‘oh so straight’?! Supposedly, Bellatrix gave birth to Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts in Malfoy Manor. WHAT?! In Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, we actually see her there! Don’t you think anyone would have noticed? DRACO ACTUALLY LIVED THERE! How oblivious is he supposed to be then? This doesn’t make any sense!I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. There were so many things that bothered me and I don’t ever want to read this again. I regret paying this much money for it. I refuse to accept this as canon. I will pretend this doesn’t exist.

It lasted for days. It was a unique experienceto have grown up with Harry and be just a year older thanhim during the Battle of Hogwarts. The end ofDeathly Hallows essentially marked the end of my childhood.Now, I'm a twenty-seven-year-old and those feelings have been ripped to shreds yet again.Post Potter Depression.But it's worth it.Harry Potter has always been the most important book series to me since I first read them in 1999- I reread the books every year, sometimes more because of reasons - soI'll gladly take the punches Rowling continues to throw at me.Worth it.(Book Depository / Amazon US / Amazon Canada / Amazon UK)

Cynical Natalie: Beware ye who enter. Here there be spoilers the size of Aragog. Nice Natalie: What are you, narrating a movie? Don't scare them. All major spoilers are hidden, but really, we recommend going into The Cursed Child blind. Drop by after you finish!Cynical Natalie: Alright, let's get down to it. What the flip did we just read? Nice Natalie: A lovely story about family and threads we didn't know needed to be tied up, but made perfect sense when we read it. I always thought Harry was a little too caviler after the Battle of Hogwarts finished. We finally get to see the guilt-ridden PTSD part. Cynical Natalie: Stop dancing around the question like One Direction asked about Zayn's departure. You know what I'm talking about. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. (hide spoiler)] The brainchild of fanfiction writers.Nice Natalie: I admit it was a weak plot element, but I liked the parallel. The Cursed Child is ultimately about family and Harry connecting with his son. (view spoiler)[You can't say you didn't feel a little bit sad when Delphi finally thought she was meeting her father. She must have had a lonely childhood—like Harry. I bet if she looked in the Mirror of Erised, she'd see the same thing he did. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: Hooray for literature class. But that element is so full of plot holes, logic runs clean through. (view spoiler)[Bellatrix wasn't pregnant in the Deathly Hallows.Nice Natalie: Rowling didn't plan on writing an eighth story then. And pregnancies in the Wizarding world might work differently. She might have used dark magic to speed up the terms and replenish her body right before the Battle of Hogwarts. You don't know that.Cynical Natalie: I know it's ludicrous. Given that I accept your tissue-thin rationale, Delphi is a sorry, one-dimensional excuse for a villain. Nice Natalie: Time constraints. Rowling didn't have seven books this time. (hide spoiler)]Nice Natalie: Can't you focus on the good for once? What about the trick Albus and Scorpius used to send for help? That's old-school Rowling at her best, disguising useful plot objects as the mundane in the beginning and then whipping them out like a boss further down the line.Cynical Natalie: Because there's too much bad to focus on the good! Like why is Albus such a fucking idiot? (Those who want to go in the Cursed Child completely blind might want to avert your eyes) Why would he attempt to go back in time and save Cedric? Screwing with time is a bad idea, especially during a period so entwined with Voldemort's existence. Nice Natalie: I've had a lot of time to think about that. Remember that interview with Rowling? She said she deliberately smashed all the Time-Turners in Order of the Phoenix, so characters couldn't go back and mess with her plotlines. At the same time, she had Hermione drill into Harry and Ron—and by extension, us—that fiddling with the past was a bad idea. Albus missed that lesson. He doesn't know the dangers of playing with time. When he made that decision, he was extremely angry with his dad and got a bit reckless. Like father, like son. Harry used to do reckless stuff when he was mad too, like diving into Snape's thoughts or going off to find Marvolo's ring.I think if it were in book format, we would've gotten a deeper insight into Albus's thought process and rationalized his behavior, like we always did with Harry's.Cynical Natalie: You're so far up Harry's ass, you can't even see straight.The Cursed Child kinda makes me hate Harry. He abused his authority and position. Teenager Harry would've hated him.Nice Natalie: He never claimed to be perfect. And that moment you're talking about was after Albus and Scorpius went dickering around in the past. It had to have caused ripples in his personality.Cynical Natalie: While we're talking about the first altered timeline, I can't believe my intelligent, level-headed Hermione turned into a bitter spinster just because she and Ron didn't get married. Nice Natalie: I didn't read it like that. I read it as a Ron/Hermione moment. She needs Ron's humor to balance out her stuffy side and Ron needs someone who will understand him on Hermione's level.Cynical Natalie: Oh, I didn't realize Ron mattered anymore. Because he's clearly been downgraded to the comic relief character. One of the main themes of the original series was to show Ron was more than a sidekick. He was his own person, brave and loyal, and deserves to stand in the light instead of the shadows of his friends.Nice Natalie: Again, I read it as far more positive. Ron isn't the insecure teenager he was anymore. He has nothing to prove, not to himself, not to anyone else. He's comfortable on the sidelines. After all, according to Rowling, this is the guy who resigned from his job as an Auror to run a joke shop.His role during the climax was beautiful. (view spoiler)[Harry chooses to stay behind to witness his parents' death and Ron says, ""We'll watch with you."" That's him; that's the youngest male Weasley to the letter. (hide spoiler)]Cynical Natalie: There are still a lot of inconsistencies. Why is McGonagall the headmaster? Rowling said she ""getting on a bit"" in an interview and Hogwarts got a new headmaster after the Battle.Nice Natalie: She probably didn't want so many new characters. That's partially why Luna, Teddy Lupin, and most of the Weasleys didn't show up. Let it go, will you? It's a tiny thing.Cynical Natalie: Fine. What about—to quote the fine folks over on Twitter—the gay panic with Albus and Scorpius?We're not the kind of people read homoerotic subtext in everything. We didn't see it with Naruto/Sasuke and we don't see it with Dean and Castiel from Supernatural. It's not until others pointed it out that we saw potential signs. But the sexual tension between Albus and Scorpius was off the charts. I was shipping them from day one. And the shit Rowling has them say... My God.Snape's famous declaration and ""They belong together""—Right, absolutely platonic.Nice Natalie: Rowling probably wanted to go for a Lily/James parallel with Rose and Scorpius. You can't please all the shippers.Beside, like you can hate anything that has to do with Harry Potter.Cynical Natalie: ...Nice Natalie: Right?Cynical Natalie: ...I hate you.Nice Natalie: But you don't hate Harry.Cynical Natalie: This is a sentimental rating, not a logical one.Nice Natalie: We read on emotion, darling.Cynical Natalie: Fuck off.Other Nice Natalie/Cynical Natalie brawls reviews:The Fault in Our StarsA Girl Like YouIf I StayDreams of Gods & MonstersThe MartianMe and Earl and the Dying GirlCatching FireAll The RageAn Ember In The AshesThe Hammer of ThorThe Ship of the DeadCaravalWarcrossThe Last Namsara

He turned into an insensitive and arrogant guy. Regardless he's a father, this is not the Harry Potter I knew from books 1-7. He matured a lot from those books and learned from many people in his life including Albus Dumbledore, Hagrid, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin etc... I don't like Albus Severus. He's a reckless, ungrateful, stupid idiot. Most of the time I want to crucio his butt for acting impulsively without THINKING TWICE (view spoiler)[Stealing a time turner to travel back time to save Cedric Diggory and the fate changes.

Dumbledore returns as a moving painting, there's time-turners and polyjuice potion and sneaking around in invisibility cloaks and raids on the Ministry of Magic. It's silly yet serious, and filled with thrills and intrigue, and most of all fun.But more than any of that, the Harry Potter universe is known for its characters, and in this installment, a couple more can now be mentioned with the best. Harry's son, Albus, is an outcast--everything Harry isn't, in a bad way, and the two struggle to relate until Albus becomes so isolated he starts falling down the same path that Voldemort did. And then there's Draco's son, always around, leading Albus down the wrong path, bringing up bad-blood from the past, and helping Albus make monstrous mistakes--all while having a personality that's sure to win you over.

No longer can I get Harry Potter from the library and be guaranteed of being the first to read it. That being said, I was determined to read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child before my kids got their hands on it; I easily finished in a few hours and rate this play 3.5 stars. I am sure this fan fiction version of nineteen years later was magical on the stage. As a book, however, I was left wanting more. I have read the series countless times and, still believe that reading JK Rowling's masterpiece is like apple pie a la mode, the ultimate comfort food. While it was pleasant to re-enter Harry's world, Rowling ended the series in a perfect place. The fact that I still want to read it from time to time is testament to its lasting legacy. Perhaps, if I was nineteen years younger, having started reading about Harry as a child rather than a college graduate, I would be more thrilled by this story. When all is said and done, this play is fan fiction. I might not have loved it as much as the original books, but I am guessing that the kids of Albus' and Scorpius' generation will enjoy it just the same. A fun read for a summer's day but I would still prefer to stay up late with a copy of the original books.

Wickedly Wonderful!!!
This is the Eighth book in the “Harry Potter” series. This is not a novel per se, but a special edition featuring the rehearsal script for the theatrical play staged in London.
THE WAITING TIME

Love blinds.
When I knew about the staging of a theatrical play about Harry Potter, it was a bittersweet feeling, since I was happy to know that there will be a new chapter in the wizarding world of Harry Potter but sad since I couldn’t apparate in London to attend to that theatrical play and it was very unlikely to be ever set here, in Costa Rica. However, I was quite happily shocked when I read that there will be a publication of the theater script, and even better, published just a day later of the premiere of the theatrical play. I guessed that maybe after a couple of years, when the play would be presented in major cities, then, it would be a publication of the story, but happily, I have no doubt that the publishing houses (UK & USA) wanted a piece of the magical new cake.
The world changes and we change with it.
So, I counted the days, I enlisted myself in a waiting list in the main local bookstore here. I even checked out twice to verify that I was still in the list! I didn’t want that any Death Eater mischief would deprive me of having the new book of Harry Potter, in the very day of its publication.Since the last book (the seventh) of Harry Potter, I’d read the novels of Cormoran Strike series, written also by J.K. Rowling (under the pseudonym of “Robert Galbraith”), and not matter my opinion about those books……it wasn’t the same!They weren’t Harry Potter books!!!This incoming (and already published) book was something else, it was a NEW story about the wizarding world of Harry Potter.And I was there, in the bookstore, buying the book, and once I had it finally in my hands……I had a wicked smile in my face!
WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HANDS

…there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic.
I loved the book! I-LOVED-THE-BOOK-!It could be better? Yes, obviously anything can be better, but there isn’t such thing as perfection in this world, so why crying for the impossible and not enjoying what you really have at hand?
The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.
You have a Harry Potter book in your hands! A new story! A canon tale! Don’t you get it?You have magic in your hands!!!Enjoy it. Hug the book. Feel the dust jacket. Smell the pages. Read it without rush. Not every day you can read real magic translated into words.
BACK TO THE MAGIC

They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what – those flaws almost made them greater.
The story is set nineteen years later of the end of the events in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Harry Potter is already an adult, married, with three children, and full of work in his position at the Ministry of Magic (No, I won’t tell which is, but it’s cool!!!).Hermione Granger is an adult too, married, with two kids, and with a position too in the Ministry of Magic (No, I won’t tell neither, but it’s cooooool!!!).And you will have the most of your favorite characters (minus Luna Lovegood, which sadly wasn’t used in the book) and it will be exciting to read about how their lives follow after the last time that you read about them, specially since the story is set so many years later.This isn’t only a new chapter in the wizarding world of Harry Potter but a closure, where we can feel the consequences of the events through the saga, how they impacted in the past, how they are driving the present, and how they can modeling the future.Albus Severus Snape, the youngest son of Harry Potter, isn’t having an easy childhood since there is the huge family legacy which is a too heavy burden for a young boy.Scorpius Malfoy, the only son of Draco Malfoy, isn’t having an easy childhood neither since his own kind of family legacy is still something that a kid shouldn’t suffer besides his own normal teenage troubles.An unexpected friendship will be forged.And as before, the power of friendship will be key to save the world.The Battle of Hogwarts was won by the heroes. Voldemort is dead. For nineteen years, peace has been enjoyed.However, there is still a powerful force of evil around, a new one but linked with the old dark magic, and with an ambitious agenda that can literally re-write everything that we already had for granted, rising a new dark age like any other before!You’ll have magical adventures, you’ll face exciting challenges, you’ll have priceless surprises.You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll live again the wizarding world of Harry Potter!!!
Those we love never truly leave us,… There are things that death cannot touch.
The magical world of Harry Potter will never leave us, we’ll have it in our hearts forever.Thank you, J.K. Rowling......thank you for sharing your magic with us.

There are two rules to enjoy this book as much as possible :
1) You have to overcome the thought you have had in your head that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the sequel to the Harry Potter series.2) Seeing this book as if it's just fanfiction or a script will prevent your disappointment.Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a script. In my opinion, I look at this as fanfiction of the series I hold close for many years. I protected myself from the feelings that would destroy my time reading this book by repeating that, and it turned out I thoght this book was helplessly fun even if it was not my fondness. However, I had a hunch that Rowling didn't take a big part in this book, it just — weird and wrong; I couldn't smell her signature in there.Albus Severus Potter takes a big role in this book. He has problems with his Dad, Harry, so he goes back into the time when Cedric was killed. And the consequence is really bad. REALLY REALLY BAD !I felt like this was another version of the Harry Potter franchise being thrown into the mix with The Butterfly Effect movie. Whoever wrote this— I can't remember their names— tried to insert and present the old characters to the play and the only way to do this was turning back time. It's so messy and does nothing good. There are many ways to present this without using this Into the Future plot.Instead of turning the prequel to the play, they showed us what happens after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Act one and two were interesting with a new character I liked. Scorpius, he's Draco's son and has very much chemistry whenever he's with Albus. Just one moment, I thought they're lovers, the dialogue : 'You two — you belong together' made me think that way and I couldn't help myself to ship them so hard till the end.
""That’s the thing, isn’t it? About friendships. You don’t know what he needs. You only know he needs it. Find him, Scorpius. You two — you belong together.""
(view spoiler)[I wanted to puke when I knew Delphi is the heir of Voldemort and Bellatrix. (hide spoiler)] Ummmmmm I don't even know when they had an affair or anything, it seemed unbelievable to me.Act four was hard to enjoy, though. I was afraid they might ruin everything in the previous books with a time-travel plot. Alas it ruined some parts of my feeling, but not much. It was just okay because I kept telling myself all the time but this is fanfiction and don't take it serious.All in all, I quite enjoyed this but I also hope wholeheartedly that this book is a full-length novel, not a script, or Rowling just let the story end that way with those seven books I want to cherish forever.I have a question. Will this book be turned into a full novel in the near future ? If it's a big YES, I'll read it undoutedly ! Because it might be better if the book is more descriptive than this.HP is my life, and this book is a drop of honey to quench my craving this year.More at https://goo.gl/I48iFE | http://goo.gl/m88lvl

This is like the weirdest thing I've ever read. And I read it in a single day. It was just so goofy that I didn't even find the story itself funny, just the whole premise of what they were trying to do was ridiculous. I don't believe a word of what happened in it as being canon! I just consider it another fan fiction that just happened to be co-written by J.K. Rowling. Really bad fan fiction. As I started reading, I ran into my house to get a notebook because I just had to write down everything that happened as it happened. (I also had a cold and was really enjoying the cough medicine) Anyways, here is my shpeel:⦁	No! No! No! No! No! What happened to choices? Why is Albus in Slytherin? It was bad enough when I got Slytherin on Pottermore, but not sweet little Albus, too!⦁	Scorpius as Voldemort's son? I didn't think Voldy had genitals.... (+ time turners don't work that way...)⦁	A year later and Albus is fighting with his father?? I miss ""All was well....""⦁	Umm...this stuff about Voldy's nose and that Scorpius' is normal sounds like it was written by a 10-year-old fan....⦁	Rose and Albus don't get along :'(⦁	I thought McGonagall had retired?⦁	Albus' little temper tantrum (26)⦁	ASTORIA MALFOY DIED??⦁	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slam on the brakes. Another time-turner? It goes back MORE than an hour?⦁	Theodore Nott: hope for a REAL antagonist!⦁	Mr. Diggory :'(⦁	Getting Cedric back? Not likely....⦁	Petunia died too? Rowling's death pen strikes again!⦁	41: Classis Disney heart-break line: ""I wish you weren't my son.""⦁	Tell me Hagrid didn't say ""Oops-a-daisy."" Who is the target audience here? (I'm dreaming, right?)⦁	Wish Albus was more like James or Lily? I might swear here...⦁	Is Albus a Horcrux, or what? Never mind, I think Harry is still dreaming...⦁	Scorpius to Rose: ""You smell like fresh flowers."" What's going on here?⦁	14-year-old boys hugging? No thank you...⦁	Jumping off a train? Really? Can't Albus be nice to Rose, too?⦁	No more Triwizard Tournament? Too bad...⦁	What's the big deal with Cedric all of a sudden? And um, uh-uh, we cannot just bring people back! You're slipping here, Rowling. And what does Albus care about Cedric?⦁	The Trolley Witch is too goofy!... (A page later:) She just got worse! (56)⦁	Harry's comment about trolls, giants, and werewolves seems very racist. ALL are Voldemort's allies?⦁	Hermione, why bring up the scar? Really? (58)⦁	Hermione is MINISTER FOR MAGIC? Why, why, why?⦁	Male nurses dancing the tango? I think I heard of this movie, but we couldn't watch it in school. Too inappropriate.⦁	Is Voldy possessing Albus to do all this goofy stuff? To go back and change the past, so that in the graveyard, Voldy never takes Harry's blood and Harry dies for good?⦁	Oh Ron, I don't need to hear about your cracking joints!⦁	""Nothing scares me. Except Mum."" Ron, are you just comic relief?⦁	Where did they get the hairs for the Polyjuice Potion?⦁	Why are they so chummy with Draco?⦁	Hermione is black (apparently). Tell me Scorpius and Albus are not a couple!!⦁	EWW! Albus (as Ron) kisses Hermione! Yuck!⦁	""Let's have another baby."" So now Albus wants to sleep with his aunt??⦁	Books grab people (I've stopped using excessive question marks. Just know that they're there.)⦁	Bedwetting?? Or wet dreams...AWKWARD!⦁	Again, this is really weird. And goofy!⦁	92: Albus must be a Horcrux or something, because why can Harry dream about where he is? But wait...Harry is no longer a Horcrux...hmm.⦁	No Neville or Luna? Oh...⦁	Only the first few scenes were actually ""Nineteen Years Later."" The tagline is misleading.⦁	Umm...people HAVE died in the tournament (98)⦁	No time to waste? You have a time-turner, doofus!⦁	The stage directions...what was she smoking?⦁	Wow, way to offend all of France! (107)⦁	'Kay, time travel doesn't work this way. That's why Rowling had time turners destroyed. In book 3, Harry could save himself because in the future he would have had gone back already, sort-of. The future-past selves already existed.⦁	How'd the grown-ups get there? And this sounds like Alice Through the Looking Glass.⦁	Oh...or did they come back to the present?⦁	Albus is a great liar? That's so sad. This is not Harry Potter right now.⦁	Gryffindor common room? Was he just a Slytherin in his own mind?⦁	There's that ""Thank Dumbledore"" again. Is he God?⦁	Oh gosh, not one of these messed up time travel stories where Ron is really married to Padma Patil. Noooooo....⦁	Ah. Time change. Albus is now a Gryffindor.⦁	What's a Panju?⦁	Boy, Harry's rude to McGonagall. P.S. Could she have had a child?⦁	Hermione is a teacher now? Only those who can't do, teach. So was Ron the reason she became successful?⦁	Harry: I don't want to hurt you, Draco. Draco: How interesting, because I do want to hurt you. :) (129-130)⦁	135: How you know a woman wrote this: Draco wants to talk about feelings....⦁	Ginny wasn't lonely! She had Luna and Neville.⦁	138: Wow, the blatant explanation of Ron and Hermione's love story.⦁	Yay, McGonagall is on the kids' side!⦁	Scorpius: Always. (144) He's not Voldy's son; he's Snape's!⦁	Wait, if the kids save Rose, they kill Panju! Not fair! What makes one life worth more than another? Wow, Harry immediately figures out they have the time-turner. And I repeat: why all the fuss about Cedric?⦁	This is essentially the YouTube video of ""How Harry Potter Should Have Ended."" ⦁	Hi everyone. Sorry for freaking out, but I just, and I mean JUST realized that I'm not supposed to take this book seriously. I'll be cool from here on in. I hope.⦁	Umbridge is headmistress now. Okay.⦁	Harry's dead. Okay.⦁	Voldemort Day. Okay.⦁	Children, don't do drugs. Ever.⦁	Mudbloods tortured in the dungeon. And ""Potter"" is now a swear word. Okay.⦁	Cedric is a death-eater. Okay.⦁	Oh, is Snape still alive? Okay.⦁	178: Very blunt explanation of Snape. Okay.⦁	Scorpius is Scorpion King. Okay.⦁	Neville is dead, too. All the deaths Rowling didn't have the heart to do in the first place. Okay. Killed by Cedric. Okay.⦁	Not sure Nagini had to die FIRST. Voldy could have died, and then his snakey. But, okay.⦁	Who told Scorpius about Snape's life? Did Harry make it public knowledge. How rude. Whoops...okay.⦁	Oh, boy, who are we meeting now? (180) Sorry...okay.⦁	Ah, Snape/Ron/Hermione rebellion. Okay.⦁	Wanted now? Sounds like Shrek 4 with the ogres. Okay.⦁	Oh, this is another time again and Ron is not married to Padma. Okay.⦁	Discombobulated. Okay.⦁	""I didn't just quote Dumbledore, did I?"" Okay.⦁	Hermione's big self-sacrifice. Okay.⦁	""Kiss me."" Wow. Okay.⦁	So Scorpius IS a king? Okay.⦁	""My light in the darkness."" Snape. Okay.⦁	Will resume notes for part two during my second re-read! Just gotta get through it! (III.xii)⦁	Good morning! I finished the book last night...only time I've read a book in one day. It must have been great...wait, no, that's not why...anyways... P.S. I haven't had any cough syrup today...maybe I had too much yesterday...⦁	Ron was drunk at his wedding. Okay.⦁	Silver and blue hair. Okay.⦁	Wow, no niece for Amos! Okay.⦁	Who made this prophecy? Okay.⦁	Still not sure how Delphi or Voldemort can fly. I thought it was impossible. Okay.⦁	I still think Harry should have understood Parseltongue. Voldy gave him his powers, as well as a piece of his soul. But okay.⦁	So Voldy does have genitals because he had a child. Okay.⦁	Very awkward love speeches between Harry and Dumbledore. Unrealistic. And based on what Rowling has said about Dumbledore, what kind of love does she mean? Okay. Too much emotion, but okay.⦁	The message in the blanket and the time-line doesn't totally make sense. But okay.⦁	More Polyjuice Potion. Okay.⦁	So Harry still is a Parselmouth. Okay.⦁	Stuck as Voldemort forever. Unlikely. Okay.⦁	""Zapping."" Okay.⦁	So Delphi is Voldy's and Bella's child. Someone predicted this on Mugglenet about three years ago. Everyone thought it was impossible, but the author made many good points, like Bella's absence from battles in Half-Blood Prince. Wait...I think this same thing happened on The Young and the Restless last week.⦁	So the killing curse doesn't hit anybody. Okay.⦁	Harry watches his parents die again. Okay.⦁	Oh god, not a fear of pigeons! Okay.⦁	Pointing out Dumby's and Snape's flaws. Every fan online has done that! But, okay.⦁	Still not sure what the significance of Craig was. That's okay.⦁	HP is too mushy for my liking. But at least the book is over, and I can pretend it never happened. The end. And I think Scorpius was actually the Cursed Child. But okay.And my notes end there. In hindsight, I believe Albus wanting to bring Cedric back to Amos was a metaphor for the connection he wants with his own dad. I'm just not sure this was the right way to do it. Anyways, I'm off to start reading something that makes more sense!!Please enjoy reading my commentary alongside your own copy of Cursed Child for ample reading pleasure. I'm going to have more cough medicine and read a real book!I just wanted to add as well that this book essentially covers every angsty teen's theory's of the book. Let's look at every horrible thing that happens:-Time turners mess everything up-Albus gets Slytherin-Incestual innuendos-The return of Snape-Voldemort has sex with BellatrixGAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! We were good, loyal fans, right? Following Rowling like obedient little puppy dogs, right? All I can say: GAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!I'm actually working on re-writing this, and I'm enjoying it much more! WHY HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(I used young pictures of Helena Bonham Carter)https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jlwDFrlG-H...

4 stars! So before I review this book, I have a confession to make. As much as I love Harry Potter (I have a dog named Dobby ffs) I’ve never read a Harry Potter book. I love the movies. I’ve seen them multiple times. Growing up, it was my sister’s favorite book series. It’s also my husband’s favorite book series. And one of these days, I’ll get to it… but I haven’t yet. Okay, so this is my first book I’ve read by JK Rowling. My husband pre-ordered and it was sitting on my kindle so I decided to jump in. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this book. The story is written in as a play- so the format is like a script. Which was fine by me, I was a thespian and have read many scripts, so it was easy to follow. I think it would be easy for anyone to follow, though. This book focuses on Harry Potter’s son, Albus Severus Potter. Albus is getting ready to go into his first year at Hogwarts and he is nervous. Which house will he be sorted into? Will he make friends? Being the son of Harry Potter isn't an easy thing for Albus. There was a lot of action and twists and turns in this story, and I’ll keep that a surprise for readers, but what I really loved about this book was the friendship between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. Scorpius was by far my favorite character in this book. I adored him. 

“The world changes and we change with it. I am better off in this world. But the world is not better. And I don’t want that.”

 I also really loved seeing our favorite characters grown up and parents. Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, even Draco. I loved how much Draco loved his son. I’ve seen a lot of fans of this book not love the script. And a lot of them are completely fan-girling over it. I liked it a lot. It wasn’t an epic 5 star read for me, but I thought it was good. Once I finally read the entire series, I’ll come back and re-read and see what I think. For now, I give it 4 stars because it was highly entertaining and I didn’t want to put it down.(This is just a fun picture collage of my sister and me at the midnight release. That Patronus on the drink menu was delicious and there were tons of people dressed up! We had a blast :) )

So much so my best friend Kyle (shout out Kyle Green you're the real MVP) took me to Big W at 8:30am this morning so we could wait for the doors to open. Thankfully, our town is kind of small so despite there being a dozen or so people there wasn't a lot overall like there would be in a larger city. I saw spoilers for this book months ago and I was slightly disappointed by them. Thankfully, in the entirety of this book I enjoyed them. They were absolutely well done in the way that I couldn't put the book down for the three and a half hours it too me to read it. I'll do my best to mark spoilers, but it's quite difficult considering spoilers are what I love to do it seems. I loved reading about our next generation characters though I had some problems (hence a four star rating). I was frustrated that we didn't get to see more of Lily and James. They popped up in the beginning but basically disappeared once the storyline got intense. The same goes for Rose. I understand that Albus didn't like her but Scorpius did. Though, she didn't like Scorpius. I just wish she could have been included in their adventures a bit more, maybe making a trio among themselves. I also didn't like the fact Teddy didn't feature at all, and we didn't get to see Molly or Arthur or George or Charlie or Fleur or Percy or Bill or Victorie. I wish there was more to characters that I was thinking about at the end of Deathly Hallows.The script format of the book got a tad frustrating in some parts. I understand it's the special edition script and all of that, and I'm lucky to have read scripts before so I could follow it well, but at some parts I had to re-read sections in order to grasp the setting. In the beginning, it didn't feel much like JK Rowling to me either. To be fair though, I only read the Harry Potter books for the first time this year. But, I felt like the dialogue was forced in a way that made me uncomfortable to read interactions between Rose, Albus and Scorpius. Characters - probably spoilersThere were so many characters present in the book, so I'm going to try to focus on the primary three in order to keep this review an acceptable length. Albus was one of our three primary characters (along with Harry and Scorpius). He was frustrating. He made me want to punch him in the nose countless times. Albus just didn't feel like he belonged no matter the effort people put into trying to make him feel as if he did and as soon as he was sorted into Slytherin it was used as an excuse to basically be an asshole to his family. Sure, James and Lily teased him but that's what siblings do. They won't fall at your feet because Harry Potter is your father, because he's their father too. Despite the fact Albus hated how people only saw him for his father (it happened like twice his first year in the script and that was when he was sorted). I loved his character development though. Going from a sullen boy who hated everything to one who could now see the world with open eyes was great. I no longer wanted to punch him in between the eyes when the book was finished and that's some hardcore character development in my opinion. Scorpius was my favourite character by far. A character who had been plagued by rumours that he was actually Voldemort's son and not Draco's would have hurt, but this kid didn't let it get him down. He was smart, funny, and optimistic. The best friend to Albus as well. Scorpius, however, was a follower and no way a leader. I did get annoyed when he let Albus push him around or order him around. It made me want to punch him in between his eyes. Though, we do have Scorpius stand up for himself at the end of the book. Using his intelligence as well to save the day. He was the Hermione Granger of his duo (Albus being both Ron and Harry combined). Harry is now Minister of Law Enforcement, I can't remember the exact title don't shoot me, he is also nearing the ripe age of 40. I couldn't really connect with Harry in this book, he didn't seem to be trying a lot of the time to help Albus but decided to just blame himself and be done with it. In the book Harry compares himself to Dumbledore (in a negative way) and I couldn't have agreed more (I'm not a Dumbledore fan). Thankfully, character development exists and we have Harry working himself out to connect with his middle child - the one ""named after the two bravest men he knew"". I don't really have much to say on Harry. He was more so a side character. Though, I enjoyed the fact through him we got to see Draco, Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Minerva. World-BuildingThe world-building wasn't exactly there. I presume the expectation to read this book is that you have read the first seven books in order to understand both jokes and the magic. Since it's a script it also lacks the detail that Rowling provided in the original series. However, knowing the world made this enticing. I loved how we got to see different places and travel back in time. It was still incredibly well done, but obviously not up to the standard I was expecting in a Rowling book. PlotThe plot was magnificent in my opinion. Sure, if you've read the spoilers, it doesn't seem that exciting. It seems a bit all over the place. It wasn't. It flowed perfectly for the most part (only confusing me a few times). I loved how the past and present intertwined and how mistakes were made that had to be rectified. I wasn't expecting the ending, (view spoiler)[with Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. It definitely shocked me. I mean, I didn't trust Delphi but damn, I wasn't expecting that. I must have missed the spoiler (hide spoiler)] Oh, and (view spoiler)[Snape in the world where Voldemort was a ruler was actually a pretty good guy. I wasn't even mad and I'm definitely not a Snape fan. (hide spoiler)] OH, OH (view spoiler)[I'm also pissed we never got to see Neville. That's all I freaking wanted. (hide spoiler)] WritingThe writing was phenomenal. Despite the fact it was a script the dialogue was poetic and classic Rowling, with classic quotes from the original series and characters. There were also scenes from (view spoiler)[The Goblet of Fire (hide spoiler)] which provided a sense of nostalgia. It was enticing in the way, as well, that it was a script, though it definitely made the book feel shorter than what it was. OverallOverall, THIS BOOK IS LOVE. THIS BOOK IS LIFE. THIS BOOK IS A GIFT TO HUMAN KIND. THIS BOOK BROUGHT ME TO TEARS. THIS BOOK HAS LEFT ME ACHING FOR MORE.I desperately wish I could go to England to watch the play. It would be beautiful to see on stage. I also liked the fact I could imagine both the play cast and movie cast in this script. It did lack some of the personality of characters, like Harry, but it was still a spectacular read and dive back into the magical world. EDIT 01/08/16: I have to add in the fact that Scorpius telling Rose she smells like bread is my favourite scene in the script. Primarily becasue I love bread and those two are my new OTP.EDIT 07/08/16: I keep thinking about this book and my massive problem with it - The Trolley Lady. I felt that the random plotline of her being robot like or immortal was strange and completely unnesscary. It keeps bothering me, even days after I finished this book and I remembered I hadn't mentioned it in my review.

It’s like JKR didn't even write this!JKR didn’t fucking write it. It said in the articles about the upcoming release of the book that it was written by people who WRITE PLAYS. It is based on JKR’s ideas about what happened after the 19 years later epilogue. Maybe your problem with the book starts with you not being able to fucking read in the first place?It doesn't star our favorite trio!!Again, it said in the blurb that it was centered around Albus Severus Potter. Did it say- “HEY! Check it out! Here is a new tale surrounding Harry , Ron and Hermione. Here is their latest adventure!” ? Nope. Sure fucking didn’t.  This doesn't read like a HP book.Oh, I don’t know…maybe because it is a fucking PLAY? The rest of the books were books. This is a play put into book format…as it clearly states EVERYWHERE. This is just like some HP fanfic I read.  Or  I’ve read better fanfic.Well that explains it. Your first mistake was reading fanfic in the first place. Fanfic is NOT relevant. Period. Fanfic is exactly what it says: Fiction based on a fan’s dreams. I could spin a tale that would blow your fucking mind, but no one cares. The end. STOP reading fanfic. The only HP stories that matter are the ones that JKR writes or has others, like these PLAYWRIGHTS for example, write. Hermione would never have worked for the Ministry! She even says so! Well, according to JKR she does. Because, as most of us do, Hermione finds out in the real world that change doesn't happen the way you want it to. It’s politics and it sucks. And sure, being a leader of some noble cause like S.P.E.W. is great and rewarding, she knows she won’t see real change without diving into the system she hates. It’s called life. We grow up and realize that while our dreams are beautiful and sparkly things, a lot of times they do not pay the bills. She’s qualified and determined, why NOT be a powerful woman in government?! But Ron was an Auror, like Harry !Yeah, and he probably realized that a.) it wasn't nearly as exciting as he wanted it to be, b.) he is not Harry and c.) that his brother might be a tad lonely running the joke shop he started with his now-dead twin brother. Let’s be completely honest here- did Ron really make sense as an Auror? I LOVE Ron Weasley. He’s been my favorite HP character since day 1, so this is not me Ron-hating. This is me being 100% real. Ron was always lazy. He never wanted to do homework- can you truly imagine him being a government official?? Give me a break!This book was so much fun! It was exciting. It was interesting. It was JKR exploring a few elements of the magical world that ALL HP FANS wanted explored- hence the THOUSANDS of fanfic stories available. So why the fucking hate? Because you can’t read the blurb or article that explained to you exactly what you were getting? *head explodes*Albus is struggling with the reality of being the son of the famous Harry Potter. His older brother is well-liked and popular, captain of the Quidditch team. But Albus? Albus is the outcast- he’s in Slytherin like he feared. Sure his dad says he doesn't care, but how can he say that when he was the biggest name to come out of the Gryffindor House? And to add insult to injury- again in Albus’ perception- he has befriended the son of the hated Draco Malfoy. Scorpius and Albus are BFF’s. Are they in love? Maybe. And that’s ok too! Just know that these two have an incredible friendship and it is beautiful.There’s so much packed into such a small story. The old hag that runs the trolley for the Hogwarts for example. How did you NOT enjoy that? It was fucking awesome. Time-travel. Alternate realities. Friendship. Love. Grief. FRIENDSHIP. Life. Real life. Parenthood. Individuality. Did I mention friendship?I loved the fuck out of this book and I honestly just don’t get the mixed emotions. And I’m one of the biggest HP nerds on the planet. So, everyone who is outraged, this is me telling you to take a step back, breathe a little and re-read this super fun book before I cut you.

I want to rate this book five stars and I want to rate this book one star.

“When spares are spared, when time is turned, when unseen children murder their fathers: Then will the Dark Lord return.”

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a script from the play (currently only playing in London) that stars Albus Potter, Harry and Ginny's middle child, and his best friend, Scorpius Malfoy. Obviously we are not used to those last names being friends, let alone best friends, but their friendship is the best thing about this story. The second best thing is seeing Slytherin in a positive light. We, so far, have only read thing in this series that star Gryffindor's golden child. Reading other perspectives and representations of Hogwarts houses was amazing, and I wish we could get a lot more of it. I was hesitant when I found out this script was going to be released as a book. All around me, everyone was jumping up and down, squealing with excitement. I was just going over in my head all the things that could go wrong. The Harry Potter series was perfect, and I didn't want a dark cloud looming over what I consider my childhood.I still went to the midnight release party (shout out to Henderson, NV's Barnes & Noble for being absolutely amazing, and throwing together an equally amazing and organized event!), I still felt like a kid on Christmas, I still got extremely emotional when actually purchasing this book, I still took a selfie and posted it on all my social media outlets, because I was so thankful to be able to go to a midnight release party that celebrates my favorite books of all time. Especially when I believed there would never be another midnight release after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  in 2007.The Harry Potter magic is still alive and I was holding it with my own two hands. Every page I turned in Act One was like returning to the best place on Earth. I was even more emotional while reading and I had to stop myself every few pages just to collect my feelings. This, this magic I can't describe, is why I want to give this book five stars. No other series in the world can do this and it's not all about the nostalgia factor. Harry Potter is truly magic, and that magic deserves all the stars in the world.I'm sorry, but the rest of this review is going to be filled with *SPOILERS*. I'm really not sure how to express my feelings without talking about major plot (or lack thereof) points. The biggest issue I need to address, and hope I'm not alone with this feeling, is that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child felt like the biggest queer bait in the entire world. This feeling wasn't brought about from me just hoping, there is so much subtext to help establish that Albus and Scorpius had something more than friendship. The evidence was so overwhelming, I was completely convinced and, more importantly, happy that J.K. Rowling was finally giving us something more than ""oh, Dumbledore was gay"". But alas, the entire book makes you believe these two were in love and it's for nothing. This was by far my biggest disappointment in this book.My next biggest disappointment was the fact that Harry Potter was an asshole. Like, a really big asshole. The way he spoke to McGonagall, when trying to force her to monitor his child's every movement, left me speechless. I wanted to stop reading the book right then and there.And that terrible conversation came after he already said an unforgivable comment to Albus. I am not a mother, even though I hope to one day be one, but I can't imagine, under any circumstance, would I ever tell my child I wish they weren't my child. What a horrible thing to say, that is completely filled with hate. This is the boy I watched grow up and become to the most powerful wizard of all time, while learning lesson after lesson of how to be a good person? I was dumbfounded. But you want to know who was a good father? Draco Malfoy. God, what I would give to read J.K. Rowling canon of Astoria Malfoy, who was able to help shape Draco and Scorpius into the men they are in this play. Draco showed such exponential growth, not only in this script, but since his time at Hogwarts. Such a wonderful character, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child portrayed him spectacularly. Oh, and he totally saved the day. The other character I liked a lot was Delphi. I'm going to guess others will not feel this way, because Delphi feels like the biggest fan-fiction thing about this book, but I still enjoyed it. For those of you who are masochist and are spoiling themselves by reading my review, Delphi is Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange's love child. Now, I know that this timeline feels questionable, because Delphi was supposed to be born before the Battle of Hogwarts, but I still let it slide and just enjoyed the ""surprise"". I also felt a great deal of empathy for Delphi. I think Act Four in Godric's Hollow was so sad for her, because all she wanted was to have her dad and have him be proud of her. Like, I know she was going to ruin the world, but her reasoning really resonated inside me, and I could understand her pain and desperation.I was not expecting Cedric Diggory to play such a major role in this story. As much as I love Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I wasn't crazy about this plot line. I just seemed like a convenient plot they could manipulate into making people feel that Harry Potter nostalgia. Speaking of convenient plots, I felt like the time turners were also too convenient. It worked amazing for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but it felt so wrong here. I hated this plot device, and I have to assume that time turners are all different, because the two in this book didn't work the same as the one in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like it at all, and I couldn't stop thinking about how freaking dangerous these things are, and how no one has used them in nineteen years, but all of a sudden the Potters have access to two? Talk about a big ass grey area plot point.Other things that felt horrible:-Dumbledore and Harry confessing their love to one another. Like, can you guys not? It felt so forced and awkward. I hated everything about that scene, which could have been a beautiful moment had it happened in the actual series and not nineteen years later.-No one even talking about Teddy Lupin! Like, I've already said Harry was acting like a shitty father in this book; I shouldn't be surprised if he's a shitty godfather as well. -Getting to see Lily get sorted, but no mention of Hugo's sorting. It felt so weird for them to say his name a couple of times, but get nothing about his character. I understand his last name isn't Potter, so he isn't as important to this world, but he felt so neglected to me. -How unlikable Rose, Ron and Hermione's child, was. -The Trolley Witch. Like, what the fuck did I just read? -The baby Harry's blanket. Like, did they sneak into the house and steal baby Harry's blanket so they could write a message on it for present-day Harry? I am not too convinced that Lily and James wouldn't have seen them, since they literally sacrifice themselves to protect Harry a few hours later. So why am I giving this book, that I just ripped apart with my review, five stars? Because Act One of this play brought me more joy than any other book has in nine years. Yes, I am disappointed and, yes, I will agree that the majority of this felt like fan-fiction, but I can't even put into words what small parts of this script did to me. I feel so thankful and so blessed that I was able to peak inside this world that was such a big reason for my happiness growing up. And in this world, that unconditional love and happiness deserve more than five stars. I'm sorry if this review is all over the place with things I liked and didn't like. I completely apologize if this seems really unorganized to you. I literally just sat down and starting typing all my feelings out and ended up having this cathartic experience. I completely understand the plot holes, and I hope I've listed all the major ones, and I understand that many of these characters that I grew up with were not acting like themselves. I also understand that I'm choosing to ignore a lot of these things, because, honestly, mostly nostalgia. I understand these one star reviews, and if I could separate myself from all the things that Harry Potter means to me, I probably wouldn't give this a five star rating.

4.5 stars I have to be honest, I wasn't that excited for this. I consider myself a decent Harry Potter fan. I've read the series a few times and consider the series a staple of my childhood and an all-time favorite. Those books got me through hard times when the best thing I could do was escape to a better and magical world through books. I should've felt ecstatic at the thought of a new Harry Potter story, but I was just so certain it would be disappointing. I knew I would read it no matter what... but my expectations were low.The Harry Potter series likely established my love for reading and I always felt like I grew up with Harry. Reading the books now and even watching the films brings true nostalgic feelings, but also a sadness that nothing else will ever be as good. Nothing will bring me those feelings of joy and wonder I experienced the first time I read Harry Potter.But last night I got a little taste of that joy again. This screenplay is not perfect by any means. There are moments where the characters behave so OOC and at times it's obvious that JK Rowling did not write this. But then there are parts that reminded me why I love this world and this story so much. Overall, I feel like this screenplay captured that same wonderful magical atmosphere that JK Rowling created in her books, while introducing new characters and a new plot. It's the kind of beautiful story I expect from JK Rowling, and I'm delighted to say I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would.The direction of the plot was completely surprising for me (to be honest, I didn't even read the synopsis. Like I said, low expectations...) 10% in and my heart was already breaking. The story began unexpectedly sad while I expected more of a lighthearted adventure. The plot lacked the depth of the books but then this is a screenplay that takes about three hours to read. I really enjoyed the plot and found it totally engrossing (I stayed up til 4 am to read the whole thing in one sitting. No regrets). I don't want to divulge anything about it but I felt it maintained the right balance of revisiting the characters, places, and elements we loved from the series and also presenting new things. I felt completely immersed back into this world, which was something I didn't think this screenplay would be able to do.I loved the new characters- Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. Albus seems to be nothing like his father. He hates Hogwarts and has no friends (besides Scorpius). He's not athletic and he is a very average wizard. He feels like a disappointment to his father- like he'll never live up to his father's legacy. This was unexpected and sad for me. When I envisioned the future for Harry and co. I had basically assumed it would be a happily ever after type of situation, not family turmoil. I had expected Albus to be a lot like his father and the story to be like Harry Potter redux, but that's not what it was and I am so happy for that. This was a beautiful and meaningful story that stands on it's own. Scorpius is also an outcast for reasons you'll have to read about. But Albus and Scorpius form a true friendship and the story of their friendship gave me those same old sentimental feelings as the original story... where the bond and love among friends is more powerful than anything.Harry doesn't know how to communicate with his struggling son who is so different from him. This is where it got sort of weird. Seeing all these characters I loved as a child behaving as adults was just weird. It seemed OOC to me but then I don't know, maybe they're just adults now. Ron is just a jokester now. Ginny has no personality at all. Draco seemed a little too nice/sentimental to me. I debated with myself for awhile about how I felt about this. There's two ways this could go- I could criticize the book for reading more like ""fanfiction"" and not staying true to the original characters or I can appreciate and love this story for allowing me to experience the joy of immersing myself in the wonder, excitement, and adventure of the wizarding world once again, which is something I never thought would be possible. I'm choosing the latter. Despite its flaws, I found the screenplay to be true to the original series in the sense that it encapsulates the same warm and magical aura of the books and a beautiful story where love and friendship conquer all. To be honest, I didn't go into this expecting the same characters I originally fell in love with, and so I didn't find it that disappointing.Overall, this screenplay far exceeded my expectations. I'm dying to see this play (but that's a far off dream) and kept envisioning what it would look like on stage as I read. Tbh I don't ever read books in screenplay format. I found it off-putting at first but got used to it and then even started enjoying it, it was a very quick and easy read (except for a scene involving polyjuice potion that got a little confusing haha) and something I know I'll read again and again. And now I'm left with the same devastated feeling I had when I finished Deathly Hallows. It's overrrrrrrr and it's time to return to reality D: I guess it's time for another reread :)

Reading a play is a little bit like watching someone eat ice cream.

Is it fair to compare the feel of how a car drives to a van? Or a yak to an aardvark? I mean, apples and oranges, right? You might like both, or dislike both, but, they’re different. With that in mind, I’m not entirely sure how to rate The Cursed Child. Lines of dialogue that fell flat on the page might have popped on stage when delivered by a charismatic performer. Scenery and special effects might have added color and tension to a confrontation that seemed a bit tame. Two actors emoting for all their hearts are worth might imbue simple lines with the emotion that transcends what’s written on the page. In other words, as a performance vehicle, The Cursed Child might be stellar. As a pure reading experience, it’s…well, it’s no apple. Or novel, for that matter.So, I’m left to evaluate it solely for the content of its story, rather than quality of its language or descriptions, realizing that the story was very deliberately framed for staging. And, as a story in the HP canon…well, it’s no apple. There’s some delight to be derived from checking in with old, dear friends some years after we last saw them, especially since they’re fictional characters, which means they’re not stricken with the issues that plague, say, a reunion show for a beloved sitcom, where the ravages of time and the fickle finger of (mis)fortune is apparent on the faces (and bodies) of at least some of the stars, unless they are John Stamos, in which case they appear as they always have, with the possible exception that, if possible, their hair looks even better (if I had Stamos’s hair, I’m convinced that I could be elected Supreme Emperor of Earth; it’s that good). Ron Weasley in particular seems to be in this frame of mind, dropping in for some one-dimensional one-liner comic relief here and there, the beloved yet befuddled uncle who’s never quite sure what’s going on around him. The overall tenor and tone, however, is far more serious, and I’m grappling with mixed emotions on that front. On the one hand, one thing I (and millions of other people) loved so much about the HP books is that they made for the perfect escape from the mundane—even when they got dark, you were magically transported to another world, one where magic ruled, where Quidditch was a thing, and where butterbeer could be consumed in mass quantities. On the other…I didn’t grow up with Harry and friends—I was 22 when I discovered the series (which was right around when Goblet of Fire came out, I think), and I was well into my dotage (read: my later twenties) when subsequent volumes arrived, so I didn’t experience the trials and tribulations of adolescence alongside the characters (I did that in the sanctity of my room all by myself, albeit with the help of Tecmo Bowl, the X-Men, and pictures of Kathy Ireland). Still, I was close enough to the age group that did go through that experience to see how easy it would have been to feel like Harry, Hermione, and Ron were akin to real, live, in-the-flesh friends. And, for those people—many of whom are now, themselves, raising children, albeit perhaps slightly younger than Albus and Scorpius—I would imagine there are powerful emotions involved in seeing those friends confronting the same challenges that being a parent entails. And there’s something in seeing fictional characters to whom you’re so attached that, in an odd way, validates and informs your own life experience as much as seeing a close friend go through it might (or even, perhaps, experiencing it yourself).This is a phenomenon unique to addicted readers with avid imaginations, but the power of JK Rowling’s drug is such that she created a generation of junkies who will, I suspect, either fiercely embrace or strongly reject the experience of seeing Harry Potter, boy wizard, the one who defeated He Who Must Not Be Named, struggling to connect with his son in the most mundane ways.Parents were, as often as not, defined as much by their absence as their presence in the HP books (notwithstanding the Weasleys, who, as with Ron in The Cursed Child, resembled nothing so much as the sprawling family from an 80s sitcom family—think the Cosbys or the Seavers with wands), and to have Harry, as a parent, be so simultaneously present and absent is a conundrum. It makes sense, of course, that the boy who grew up without parents, whose father figure was simultaneously his hero and a man he could never fully trust, would struggle as a father himself; but seeing that play out on the page is heartbreaking. Fiction can, and often does, reflect the most real and painful parts of life back at us, and when we seek it out for that purpose, it can be a fulfilling and validating experience in a way few others can. When we seek escapism and magic and adventure, however, and are faced with the overwhelming reality of emotional turmoil…well, it’s disconcerting.Putting aside the staging aspects and judging this solely on the merits of the words printed on the page, as a rip-roaring HP yarn, this is somewhere in 2.5-star territory. As an exploration of how difficult it is to raise a child, no matter how good you might be at the rest of the game of life, and how emotionally eviscerating failing to connect with a tiny human that you made can be, we’ll put in 3.5-star territory.I will, undoubtedly, reread the 7 core HP novels many times in my life (as I already have). Will I reread The Cursed Child? Probably not.Unless, that is, I’m reading it with my kids, in order to stay connected with them and attuned to what they’re feeling and experiencing as they grow and change—something Harry would, by play’s end, appreciate, I think.

The writing is terrible (lines are cheesy and ridiculous), the already established characters (like Harry, Ginny, Ron, etc) are not anything like the characters we knew in the novels (I mean, NOTHING like them), the plot is unoriginal and full (I mean FULL) of plot holes, and honestly the whole time I was thinking, ""But JK Rowling provided this plot... did she forget what her story was about???"" Truthfully, it was a slightly interesting read and I'm glad I read it. But it added nothing to the story and actually, I think it took away from the story in a lot of ways. There are a lot of things I'd like to forget because it just doesn't match with what the novel's told (especially the characterization of Snape, Voldy, Cedric and others). I think that if you aren't a HUGE HP fan and you just enjoy the movies or have read through the novels once or twice a long time ago, it's possible you would really enjoy it, but for a Potterhead like me where the story is something I read every year and still remains my favorite series ever... it's a tough sell. Read it for yourself and develop you're own opinion. If you love it I'll be happy for you. That's just my opinion. And a very unfortunate one.

Aaaaand... Read. :)How was it? Was it everything I'd hoped it would be? Potterfan that I am?Hell yeah. Sure, if you all want something edgy, look elsewhere. No hot slant fiction here. This is a great buddy, father-son, father-daughter fiction. It easily fits into the cannon, with tons of revisited scenes from the originals in the form of dreams and timey-wimey stuff, but there's a reason for all of that and it's not a lack of imagination. At this point, it's both nostalgia and crazy emotional crap for the poor kids of Harry and Draco, who just happen to be best buds. Gotta love the drama around those households when the parents get into their shit, right?What's surprising is how much of a pain it is being the sons of these particular famous peeps, and just how much it turns them into loners and losers and misunderstood outcasts, and therefore ripe for our sympathy. It's a tried and true method, even for Rowling, but it's no less effective here than it was for Harry. It's odd how the same sins are always revisited, right? Well it's true across time and surrogate parentages and all the mistakes that everyone keeps making despite the very best of intentions.The drama is pure. And if you're worried that there won't be enough magic and excitement and NUTSO altered realities on huge scales and truly horrific reversals, then just relax and get very anxious, because I sat on the edge of my seat as I saw this play performed in my mind. :)Will I scream bloody murder if this doesn't get made into a movie down the line after the play-cycle has ended?Yes. Yes I will. It's a good Harry Potter book, damn it. It changes the meanings of books 3 and book 4 in their interpretations and their importance. It makes me want to do another close read of them to pick out the pieces and see where they tie back into the play. :) There's some pretty cool nit-picky stuff here for us, folks. I'm loving the easter eggs.Satisfying? Very much so. Fathers and father figures were always big in the series and it's even better now with Albus and Harry. I got all teary. :)Don't worry about all the haters. This stuff is good. :)

So I did it. The book that has been hurting my poor, Harry Potter loving heart since it's release last month. Honestly, I don't know how to feel. I went into this with very low expectations. I've read the spoilers, I've seen the reviews. I've seen so many criticisms of this, of J.K, of the writing the plot the characters. You name it - I've seen hate on it. I think those criticism are founded. CURSED CHILD does not feel like the Harry Potter I grew up with. It doesn't feel like Hogwarts. It's all so wrong. It really does read like a fanfic. The first thing that struck me was like - Wow. Harry Potter and co. are OLD. And I know this might be weird but it immediately disengaged me from them. Immediately I was unable to connect with them as I had before. When I read Harry Potter the first time he was a kid like me - I loved to go on adventures with him, to deal with the trials of school with him. His day to day life was relatable, I mean, I was a kid too. A kid who envied HIS childhood. But I mean ?! 40 year old Harry. I can't roll with that. He's immediately unrelatable to me. Alot of dialogue from Harry / Ron / Hermione was them complaining about the hardships of being old. And it's just ?? It loses the magic. It immediately pulls the magical story of wizard schools and dragons and spells and potions into something so incredibly mundane and Harry Potter should never feel mundane.The next thing that struck me was the characterization. These people are not the Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco ect. we grew up with. They're just not. In fact - half the time I was left wondering if Jack Thorne ever read the books - because these portrayals are soo movie. Ron was reduced to a wise-cracking fool who wasn't capable of anything. He felt like a weird stand-in for Fred and George Weasley. He didn't feel like Ron. Hermione was just ? silly ? So many of the things she did were soo out of character. She was stupid, she bent for others, there was a part where she refused to defend Harry and Ron? (I'm sorry but Hermione ALWAYS defends them so smh). I just ? It was all wrong. BUT THE BIGGEST ABOMINATION, the absolute heartbreak of this book resides in the charactersation of my #1 son, Harry James Potter. Now you listen here, Harry Potter is my child. I HAVE CRIED FOR THIS BOY TOO MANY TIMES. Ok ay I don't appreciate when people try to mess with his personality and call it Canon. This was not Harry Potter. His dialogue made no sense - it completely disregarded some of the fundamental aspects of his character. His respect ? gone. His sarcastic humour? gone. His unflinching bravery ? gone. His selflessness ? gone. Harry was SO RUDE, he was so mean !?! And so much of it didn't make sense. (view spoiler)[ He perpetrates rumours Scorp is Voldy's son even though he, as a child, had to also deal with terrible rumours and should sympathise. And WOULD sympathise since he's a sympathetic guy. The fact he hates Al for being a Slytherin. His treatment of McGonagall who's always been a friend/mentor to him and someone he deeply respects. His treatment of Albus with the whole map thing ?? THE FACT IT WAS EVEN SUGGESTED HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT CEDRIC DYING. No no no no no no no no.  (hide spoiler)]the only bit I liked, when I was like ayy it's ma BOY was (view spoiler)[when he wouldn't let anyone volunteer to take on Delphi like ofc he wasn't gonna let you guys this is Harry Potter  (hide spoiler)] ALL IN ALL JACK THORNE GET UR GRUBBY HANDS OFF OF HARRY POTTER HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT. 
“They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what – those flaws almost made them greater.” 
 Ok. Plotwise. The plot is kind of fun, if you ignore the huge plot holes and failure to grasp some of the basics of the actual canon. I mean, the time travel aspect was fun, and if you try not to think about it too much and ignore all the crazy conveniences that popped up to move it along it does pass as a plausible plot.But jokes because I DO think about it too much.  (PS. UNTAGGED SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT YOU'VE BEEN WARNED)  We'll start with the time turner, shall we? First of all - ok. I could accept it existed, I could allow myself that reach BUT THEN HERMIONE HIDING IT IN A BOOKCASE. wtf nooo. I mean, why tf even hide it with riddles that's ridiculous. Surely she's smarter then this (SHE IS SMARTER THEN THIS)Going back in time to save Cedric ????  Again, surely Albus and Scorp are smarter than this. Clearly thats a terrible idea. Clearly its not going to work. This whole plot point was just such a stretch. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea. It wasn't and any decent, mildly intelligent wizard should know that. (I know that and I'm a goddamn muggle)Okay. The fact that Cedric was so embarrassed it turned him evil ? wtf wtf JUST WHY. The fact he killed Neville and became a Death Eater. Can ! We ! Not ! Disrespect ! His ! Character ! Like ! This ! Oooh boy! And we haven't even got into the big thing yet. Delphi . . . .. . fucking Delphi.. GOD just NO. I mean, first of all practically it doesn't even fit in with the canon timeline (Delphi was born @ Malfoy manor before the battle of hogwarts and yet Hermione/Ron/Harry were there before the battle with Bellatrix aND SHE WASN'T PREGNANT FOR SURE. Also, the insinuation Astoria was involved (possibly raped?) by Voldermort was .. really icky. ? I didn't like that at all. Anyway, all in all that whole thing was a mess. EVEN IF voldermort COULD have kids (which lbr he probs can't) Voldermort was never available to do that, he had no reason. ?!?! URGH JUST PLS STOP it was so bad. Finally, I was really annoyed the villian was Voldermort yet again. I'm sorry but it's soo lazy. Could they have not thought up something new and funky fresh. It would have been refreshing. Voldermort coming back is So Tired and just destoys the entire point of 7 books. Voldermort is dead! Gone ! finished ! We didn't go on that horcrux hunt for nothing !!!!!! just urrrrrrgh okay other weird plot points. Albus kissing his aunt ??? g ross. The convenience of Draco HAPPENING to have another (flawless) time turner The weird outbursts from Harry at Minerva?The ""Evil base"" being in a wizards old people's home (what ) TeDDY LUPIN WASN'T IN ITRose ? ? ? ?? Rose and Scorp ??? ( sorry but there's NO chemistry there and Al and Scorp are canon boyfriends) The bit when they watch James/Lily die. The fact Harry is all 'I have to see it' even though he has seen it. Deathly Hallows. In extreme detail. It was just really uncomfortable to me. THE BIT WHEN THE TRAIN LADY ATTACKED THEM WHAT WAS THAT WHAT THE ACTUAL HECK OTHER NOTEI was also disappointed on an authorial level by J.K in this. Honestly, I was expecting more diversity. J.K champions diverse Lit on twitter, but lets be real she had a great oppurtunity to implement that and it fell through. TRUE, you can argue Hermione is black but it's not explicit so it doesn't mean anything. They could have made anyone more diverse. (The queerbaiting on Al and Scorp was REAL) but instead it's all ""white and straight"" and idk I'm just a bit disappointed in her for that. -------------------------------------------Ok. But what did I like ?Okay. It is fun. In a fanfic kind of way it is a fun story. We should never consider this canon, but it is entertaining. I did read it in one day. And I'm damn willing to bet the stage is amazing. The stage directions and settings were really amazing and I think implemented this show would be, aesthetically, really nice. I also appreciated Draco's redemption arc. That was nice, and you know what, deserved. I appreciated Snape's a little less, because I hate snape forever and always but if you're a fan I can see you'd appreciate that too. I appreciated Ginny's take on being possessed and how NO ONE helped her after Chamber of Secrets .. which .. was true. I AM SO SHOOK ABOUT HOW RON SAID EVERYONE THOUGHT SHE'D BE A SLYTHERIN LIEK GODFUCKING DAMN YES YES BEAUTIFUL I also quite liked Draco's little revelations about being jealous of the trio, and of not revealing Harry at Malfoy Manor which - ok yeah was solid work. It was just everything else that was a mess. You cannot take this seriously because it wILL fall flat. But if you are able to detach yourself from the characters and try not to view them as the one's we know and love perhaps you'd really enjoy it. I'm not able to do that, however. Which is why I can't give this any more than a 3*. It deserves a 2, sentimentality makes me bump it up to a 2.5 and that's my FINAL RATING. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? 2.5*. Sorry, not sorry. NOTE: Sick of people telling me I didn't like this because it's a script. No. No I've read scripts before, I've read scripts and loved them. This isn't bad because it's a script. It's bad because it reduces our characters to uninspired tropes, because it's full of plot holes and because it's lazy. Bye !

Clearly I felt it had some! The development of one character from the old Harry Potter world in particular was incredible and was easily my favorite part of the whole play. But piss-poor development of the other characters in this story was what caused frustration for me. The person in this play was not the Harry James Potter I adore. And that's just something I couldn't get over. Also, Snape is not nor will he ever be a hero. He is an abuser. Naming his son Albus Severus was something Harry did that I have never gotten over. And I will tell you this play did NOT make me feel better about how we are supposed to view Snape. A man who abuses children for no reason is not a hero. And he does what he does out of obsession, not love. He has no noble cause, and he is not a good man. And the way this play discussed abuse and how Harry should respond to that abuse was super not great.That's all I will add in this review for now. Honestly it was overall a fairly disappointing play, and much like everything else we have learned about the wizarding world outside of the original seven books, I do not accept this story as canon. Much more to come in a video review later.

It breaks my heart a little to not rate a Harry Potter related book 5-stars. But this was a complete & utter DISASTER. And that's coming from me; I'd be perfectly content with reading 300-pages of Hermione's lecture notes on Professor Binns discussing self-stirring cauldrons. This was without a doubt my most anticipated read of 2016. There has been a void in my life with the absence of new Harry Potter books. I was never even remotely impressed with the Nineteen Years Later chapter - I found it corny & I have done an incredible job of convincing myself it doesn't exist. I had hoped that this book would redeem that chapter, and boy, did I set myself up for a world of disappointment.If you have not yet read the book and you intend to do so, PLEASE do not read the rest of this review! I do not want to spoil anything for you! ************************************** The Cursed Child is a screenplay, it is a script, not a novel. The stage directions, accompanied with my imagination, made reading this quite easy. I had no difficulty getting into the story. The story itself follows Albus Severus through his first few years at Hogwarts at a fast-pace. Albus does not feel he fits in with his family, his relationship with his father in particular is tumultuous. Albus’ best friend is Scorpius, the child of Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts, the two are bullied and teased relentlessly. For Albus and Scorpius, Hogwarts is not home. When Amos Diggory shows up at the Potter house, Albus overhears a conversation between Amos and Harry, where Amos appeals to Harry to use a Time Turner salvaged from the Department of Mysteries to go back in time to save Cedric Diggory. Harry denies. Albus overhears and decides to take matters into his own hands, and is aided by Delphi Diggory, Amos’ niece. I do not like time travel. I’m not sure if I think it’s stupid, or I’m just too stupid to be able to wrap my head around the logistics. I think it has more to do with the notion of revisiting the past more than once (or always 3 times). I find that whole concept tired and repetitive and I just do not like it. I was ok with the Time Turner use in Prisoner of Azkaban, and I think that was because they just went back in time once. It didn’t feel tedious. However, I think bringing back a storyline motivated by Time Turner use, is a regurgitation, I felt like it was a cop out. Don't get me wrong, I liked how it took us back to be able to see the Triwizard Tournament, and even Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid (OH HAGRID), and these sort of alternate-universes. But it also felt a little too much like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is fan fiction. I have nothing against fan fiction, but I was looking forward to original Harry Potter. I’m aware a lot changes in 19 years (it’s actually closer to 22 years because of how fast-paced the timeline is), regardless, this story did not feel completely like Harry Potter. To an extent, this is perfectly ok, because this is about the younger generation living in a post-Voldemort era. However, I did not particularly enjoy the focus on the younger generation. Albus is Harry and Ginny’s son so I obviously care about him, but the scenes with snippets of older-Harry and the palpable guilt that haunts him, were my favourite parts of the story.My problem with the Deathly Hallows’ Nineteen Years Later chapter was that everything was wrapped up so conveniently, as though everything was suddenly hunky-dory in the wizarding world now that old Voldy had been off’ed. Although The Cursed Child didn’t address the bigger world issues of classism (/blood-status-ism/house-ism ??) and speciesism, I wholeheartedly appreciate the way it approached Harry’s guilt.  HARRY: I shouldn’t have survived — it was my destiny to die — even Dumbledore thought so — and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people — all these people — my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty — and it’s me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage — and it’s my fault. I liked that we were able to see Harry’s struggle with being a father, largely due to his limited familial relationships. We bear witness to the aftermath of his relationship with Dumbledore, and the impact that had upon him. The scene with Harry revisiting his past with Dumbledore’s portrait brought tears to my eyes. “DUMBLEDORE: No. I was protecting you. I did not want to hurt you...DUMBLEDORE attempts to reach out of the portrait — but he can’t. He begins to cry but tries to hide it.But I had to meet you in the end... eleven years old, and you were so brave. So good. You walked uncomplainingly along the path that had been laid at your feet. Of course I loved you... and I knew that it would happen all over again... that where I loved, I would cause irreparable damage. I am no fit person to love... I have never loved without causing harm.”Despite how immensely satisfying this was, I wanted more. I wanted to see:- If Arthur was any closer to understanding batteries, - How Molly was as an overbearing, well-meaning grandmother,- Bill and Fleur handling full-moons,- Percy working under Hermione at the Ministry (??),- GEORGE, my baby George, unable to cope with the loss of his brother; distanced from the smiling, laughing, prankster we love,- Hagrid and Grawp and Olympe working as giant-activists, not for the purpose of trying to gain allies, but to help better their ways of life,- Luna being Luna proving the existence of Crumple-Horned Snorkack's and starting a conservatory for them in Sweden,- Neville with his grandmother who has grown so so so proud of her only grandson, and Neville with his parents, Neville teaching his students about Mimbulus Mimbletonia smiling to himself as he remembers dousing everyone in Stinksap in their Hogwarts Express compartment,- Parvati Patil who still meets with Sybil Trelawney for tea every few months and afterwards they both cry as they remember their best friend and favourite student who they were unable to save during the Battle of Hogwarts, - Teddy Lupin growing up without his parents, but with a loving grandmother and loving godparents and cousin, who feels like he has no right to be sad, but he thinks about the persecution his father faced for being a werewolf, and the persecution his mother faced for simply falling in love and he can’t help but feel sad, and all the werewolves are underground and they don’t lead normal lives, and that could have been him but he was lucky but he doesn’t feel lucky … - Kreacher who still works in the Hogwarts kitchens who sometimes cleans the Slytherin dorms (even though House Elves are no longer supposed to clean up after humans, the humans are supposed to clean up after themselves) and sometimes sees Albus and Scorpius who have fallen asleep over stacks of Potions homework in the common room so he props pillows under their heads as Regulus’ locket slips out from the top of his tea cozy and lightly grazes Scorpius’ head. - Sirius Black’s name cleared, reform in the Ministry legislature that works to prevent unjust incarceration, a bill passed in his name to appeal sentences and provides fair trials for people accused of committing crimes, the House of Black used as a group home, it's a sanctuary, it's a place of safety, for children/youth who have no families, it's more than an orphanage, it's a place of opportunity. I think you get the point. I wanted more. I do understand that since this is a play, having such a large cast to incorporate these characters and their lives post-Voldemort, would be especially challenging. I really don't care about the execution challenges, it doesn’t stop me from wishing. Very briefly I want to talk about Albus. I’m disappointed in his character; the pressure he feels associated with his family name is completely understandable. What I don’t understand and what I simply CANNOT believe is that his family, siblings, cousins - the Potters' entire NETWORK of people wouldn’t do everything possible to protect Albus. This is a different generation, yes, but Albus' siblings and cousins have parental figures in Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny. You cannot possibly expect me to believe that Albus would not have cousins or siblings who would defend his ass from the petty likes of Polly Chapman? You can’t possibly expect me to believe that JAMES SIRIUS POTTER would stand by as his BROTHER was relentlessly bullied, and CALLED A SQUIB? I don’t buy it. You can't possibly expect me to believe that ROSE GRANGER-WEASLEY would be a bratty, narcisstic schoolgirl who wouldn't defend her cousin? Perhaps this is my fault for having such unwavering faith in the trio. I can't believe for one second that they wouldn't have raised their children to always look out for one another. This could be me holding them to too high of a standard, I understand parenting is hard work. But then again, you can’t possibly expect me to believe that PROFESSOR LONGBOTTOM would even tolerate such behaviour. NEVILLE, who was relentlessly bullied by both his peers and staff would NEVER allow his own students to torment one another. Even Headmistress McGonagall? Bullying tolerated under her authority? You can't even try convincing me that the bullying of Albus (and Scorpius) wouldn't even be on her radar, she has more important things to worry about as Headmistress? Nope. No there is NO fucking way. Not McGonagall. Please don’t get me started on the absurdity that is Bellatrix Lestrange hooking up with Voldemort. (Caidyn's Review goes into fantastic detail about why this seems implausible). But I just can’t even go into detail with that nonsense, it'll get me too wound up I will probably end up stabbing myself with shards of my tangible disappointment.

...........So.............Where to start ?(First of all, ATTENTION SPOILERS EVERYWHERE. Second of all, this got tragically long, I'm really sorry, and honestly this is just a mess. but so is this play. u reap what u sow xoxo)Ok so first this is a message to harry james potter fans, and them alone. Please, PLEASE, do not make my mistakes, do not read the cursed child. If you love Harry you know that he is the best person that has ever lived and therefore it is clear for everyone he doesn't deserve any of the shit happening in this book. ANY OF IT. And neither do you! He's beautiful, and you're all beautiful, and I'm beautiful, and none of us deserved this. (but especially harry)Now that that's been said, i need to add: if you think this review focuses solely on harry james potter and ignores everything every other character has been through, well, you'd be right. To be perfectly clear, i give zero fucks about other characters. i don't care about their sad lives, i don't care about their feelings and it's perfectly obvious to me that whatever they go through, none of it comes even close to whatever horror harry's living. so, i don't care about albus severus, i certainly don't care about draco malfoy, and i don't particularly care about talking about harry's flaws either, so be sure that i won't. byeANYWAY, i still don't know where to start. i don't know, as a person who has been resentful of her own parents and who is as a result suspicious of parents in general, i don't particularly appreciate this attempt to make harry james potter, my favourite character ever, someone who i've loved for 16 years and who got me through the worst moments of my life when i thought i had nothing else, someone that i've always looked up to, become everything i hate. So, really, thanks for that ! (That still doesn't stop Harry from being the most beautiful person, but still, disgusting)And aside from this personal disgust about the whole thing, i'm pretty sure there are more original ways to tell a story. because of course everyone struggles with the war, and with everything else they've been through, and the kids have to deal with who their parents are, that makes perfect sense to me, but i don't KNOW why this has to be achieved by making harry look like an asshole. i also don't know why we get this whole HARRY IS A BAD FATHER!!!!11§1&!&! thing when we don't even get the perspective of his other two children, who don't really seem to have a problem with him. maybe they do, but either way, we don't know. why? WHATEVER THIS STORYLINE WASN'T NECESSARY AND I HATE IT. but if it that wasn't enough (of course it wasn't) we then have to deal with harry behaving in ways he actually would never. my first question is WHY on earth is he head of magical law enforcement when 1) he hates the ministry 2) he has always opposed the ministry's decisions 3) he was himself a victim of the ministry and of this same department 4) he witnessed first hand how crap they are 5) WHY!!! WOULD!!! HE!!! WORK!!! FOR!!! THEM!!! AND WHY WOULD HE BE THE BOSS. I know Harry's wanted to be an auror but HE WAS FOURTEEN and in the middle of a war, and obviously i know he always wants to save the world and get the bad guys so they won't hurt anyone else but i just can't see why after the war he would have wanted this to be his daily life, and especially not by working at the ministry. But whatever i've never agreed with this anyway and i'm always going to be angry about it soooo. ok anyway being head of magical law enforcement then turns him into some asshole that threatens people for no valid reason, a person that is literally the opposite of who harry james potter is, but ok. ok. i also can't figure out a way to believe harry would actually threaten his son to spy on him by putting a spell on him to see and hear everything he sees and hears. what the fuck?????? what the fuck. good for you if you want to write harry like this but IT IS NOT HIM and he would never be this person, he was never like this and he has no reason to become this as an adult. NEVER!!!!!! And, on top of it, after i had to read this nonsense with my own eyes, who shows up to offer harry some well-needed parenting advice? DRACO MALFOY. i mean....... i don't actually have words for this. but thanks for making harry look like a loser while everyone around him is so much more sensible and better. I think that's all for BAD DAD HARRY, SHIT DUDE HARRY (no it's not but i don't want to talk about it anymore), but if only that was the only problem. No, because when they finally decide to write Harry as himself (finally indeed), they go back to what's worked so well in books 1 to 7: MAKING. HARRY. SUFFER. So i'll just make a list if you don't mind of all the SHIT (shit is a truly weak word for what he actually gets here) he has to deal with in this exciting play:- harry standing alone in his office, tired, ""the weight of the world upon his shoulders"" tell me something i don't know??????? this is harry james potter at ages 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. LET HIM LIVE- amos diggory shows up to his doorstep in the middle of the night to blame him for cedric's death- his own son, piece of shit son albus severus, mocks him for the abuse he's been through and acts like harry's ever asked any of this to happen to him, or like the world would be better off if harry hadn't been there to save it (an opinion that quickly gets shot down when scorpius stumbles into voldemort lives au. thanks harry for saving the world indeed and pretty much dying doing it)- albus severus also blames him for everyone that died during the war. why not.- this obviously results in harry feeling guilty and blaming himself for everything which, again, i have already read about in the seven previous books- albus severus who has the audacity to say harry ""doesn't care"", spare me with your teenage emo problems buddy, come to my face and tell me that harry, harry james potter, who constantly feels so much about everyone and everything, DOESN'T CARE. - (side note, i find it funny that everyone calls harry whiny during order of the phoenix and blames him for dealing with everything that happens then, when we have here in albus a perfect example of what a whiny person actually is)- harry's scar hurting again after TWENTY TWO YEARS like either he thought he was free of it and now he's not or either there was always a part of him who never totally believed voldemort was really gone, and now he has to be like ""is he. could he be back."" fun times once more- flashbacks of the dursleys abusing harry in case, again, we haven't seen enough of that before- harry then gets to yell at dumbledore('s portrait) for 5 short seconds about him sending him back to privet drive every year which is like, ABOUT TIME, but of course this part only exists so that harry can forgive dumbledore who is, i quote, ""weeping openly"" and have harry agree to say that love ""blinds people"" and make them make mistakes and that therefore everything dumbledore did is perfectly justified. which then makes harry compare dumbledore sending him to the dursleys, where he was sure to be hated and treated like shit, to himself sending albus to hogwarts, where he was sure to have friends bc HE ALREADY HAD FRIENDS. well, that's not the same, harry is not dumbledore, and i don't see why they have to make him think that. fuck you- harry then being used to say that dumbledore and snape were great men, i don't care how great they were, they wEReN'T, AND I DON'T WANT HARRY TO SAY THAT. i could write pages about forgiveness and i've never had a problem with harry forgiving them but i think there's a difference between forgiving them because that's who he is, because he always forgives, and actually justifying whatever horrible things they did, and i don't see why he always has to be the one justifying it, because if he forgives and justifies it then it almost makes it look ok. BUT IT'S NOT. FUCK OFF.- ""harry is consumed in his grief"" story of his life- another moment where he blames himself and thinks everyone would be better off if he had died like he was ""supposed to"" listen to me harry james potter i don't want to hear this!!!! you didn't do anything wrong!!!! you saved the world!!!! where would they be without you!- and then of course, the whole time turner business brings him back where? October 31st 1981, Godric's Hollow, night of his parents' deaths. excellent.- but not before having to transfigure himself into voldemort!!!!!!!! like nothing that happened to him has been enough, he has to BE voldemort. why??? W H Y. WHAT JUSTIFIES MAKING HIM GO THROUGH THIS. WHAT.- ""it has to be me"" of course it has harry. OF COURSE.- and then....... finally...... we finally reach what seems to have been the purpose of this whole play..... order has been restored, the world has been saved, they fought evil and won, all of this for what????? yes, to stand there and watch lily and james die. Yay ! - before actually seeing this tho he also has to see voldemort actually ALIVE, which is a great moment for him. i'm pretty sure this figures in his top 5 things he wanted most in his life, 23 years after his death- ginny is like ""you don't have to watch"" thank you ginny, but SADLY ""i'm letting it happen, of course i have to watch"" NO, YOU DON'T, YOU BLOODY FOOL, YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT JUSTIFIES DOING THIS TO YOURSELF. HARRY, I LOVE YOU, DON'T DO IT--- but no. he does. because having to relive his parents' murder in memories and nightmares or whenever a dementor comes close to him apparently was NOT enough, no, what he clearly was missing from his life was to witness it as a 40 year-old man. cool. just cool. - allow me to quote the exact second where he sees lily die : ""and it's like lightning passes through harry's body, he's sent to the floor, a pure mess of grief""- ............................- ............................- ............................Why ????????? WHO. Who thought this was great. What was this person's thought process? ""Hey you know what i think? harry hasn't suffered enough in his life, i think what's missing is that he should be there in godric's hollow in 1981, to see his parents die, right? he totally deserves this.""- i don't know. i don't understand this play. if i wanted to see harry suffer well i already had 7 books of it, 7 books where his life constantly gets worse, and whatever rare moments of joy (i can't even say happiness, when has this kid ever been happy?) he gets are soon replaced by moments of horror. the books end with an epilogue that make it look like harry gets to live and to be happy, but 9 years later, we find out that that's actually not the case? why doesn't his suffering ever end? obviously i know that given what he's been through he's always gonna have nightmares and he's gonna carry his scars with him and he's never gonna forget but does it have to be all he gets?? i know he's always gonna live through some painful moments ok bc he's human and we all have to go through painful moments, and the pain doesn't stop just because he's defeated voldemort and saved the world, but my question is: do we really need to see it??? what does this bring to his story ? is it character development to see him go through the same things over and over again ? is it narratively satisfying?? like, of course he feels guilty, he's always felt guilty, i know he feels guilty, i don't have to be told about how often he goes see cedric's grave to say he's sorry to know just how sorry he feels. did i mention i've loved him for 16 years ? i know very well he blames himself for everything, he feels everything is his fault and he feels personally responsible for every person he couldn't save, and while i very much love him for it, because he cares so much, because of everything he is, i actually don't want to see it. i've already seen it. i know he's sad. but i love him, and i want him to see him happy. i deserve to see him happy, and he deserves to be. contrary to popular belief stories don't have to be awful all the time. that's not what makes a story good or worth telling. at the very least, it is all sorts of terrible and disgusting to use BAD DAD HARRY as a PLOT DEVICE just to make him go through horrible things, again. the reason any of it happens is because of albus and harry's relationship. this story wasn't necessary. there were plenty of stories about harry to tell, that respected him as a person and as a character, that didn't make light of what happened to him but that also allowed him and us to see beyond it. i for one would have very much liked to see harry happy, struggling sometimes and feeling sad occasionally but still being happy, someone who is still very much caring for others, helping other people, and making the world a better place. because that's who harry is, and there were much better stories than him being a shit ass auror, a shit ass dad, because we've always known him as such a good person, and even in this horrible play, that's still what comes through, how much he cares, how much he wants to save everyone, because you can't take that away from him no matter how much you try your hardest to make him look like he's not as great as an adult as he was a kid. Ginny even says at some point that everyone sees him as The Hero, but that they fail to see how he's been heroic in quiet ways, and i think that's true, and i think focusing on that would have been better, not some grand epic hero moment where he defeats evil, because he's already done that, but just moments of his every day life where he saves the world one day at a time, one person at a time, quietly, just by helping people and making the world better. But i suppose doing that would involve being a good writer, and no one involved in this play has proven to be one.Of course, even if you focus on something in this play other than harry, though i don't see why you would, you'll realise that it is still super shit. The storyline itself, if it can even be called that, shows no originality as 1) the books have dealt with time travel before 2) let alone characters who are not who they say they are 3) i've read fics like this a thousand times before as well, as if no one has ever had the idea to make voldemort and bellatrix have a secret baby, and now we're supposed to act like this is just magnificently written and plotted. (The fics were actually better, not sorry to say, bc none of them treated harry like this.) Well, it's not, it's stupid, it is not a good story, and everyone who has the audacity to act like this is incredible and excellent storytelling frankly needs to read better books. And the play doesn't even really have a resolution. Where do Albus and Harry go from here? What do James and Lily think of the whole thing? IS HARRY GONNA BE HAPPY ONE DAY ? Not to mention it is laughable that the whole story is sort of about albus and scorpius' friendship, with some moments between them worthy of the angstiest romance novels i've ever read, only to end with scorpius asking rose out. we get it, everyone is a straight, but that adds nothing to the story and is only just another example of a boy randomly wanting a girl who doesn't want anything to do with him. And they're FOURTEEN. And why did draco randomly replace ron as harry's best friend, ron was just there to make jokes and everything happened without him, and even as someone who has definitely not been his greatest fan, i can tell you he deserved much much better. who would have thought that in the year 2016 ron weasley would be the newest victim of the drarries. everything happens i guess. and why do we have to care about draco's feelings for that matter i wish i knew (PS: special mention to severus snape basically requoting a kingdom or this to albus and scorpius. truly iconic)i don't know what else to say. this was terrible and disappointing in every possible way. The best part was ron and hermione, so i guess there will be at least one group of people satisfied with this. Good for them. But i'm just angry that Harry Potter, as a character and as a series, has meant so much to me for so long, only to end like this, for no valid reason. like deathly hallows actually ended with hope (and im not counting the epilogue), it was about harry finally being free of voldemort and the war and of course horrible things happened because it was a war and people died, and it was going to take them time to deal with this, but harry was seventeen, and he had his whole life before him, and you could feel he was going to be ok (the book literally ends with the words ALL WAS WELL). and now we're here, he's 20 years older, but he's not ok, it almost seems like no time has passed, and it almost seems like he's gonna be stuck like this forever. and even if you wanted to play the bad father harry card, there was no need for this story, like you could just introduce that harry and albus had a bad relationship, whatever, and then they could have spent the whole play fighting to make it better, to talk to each other and to learn and to become better together, but no, instead nonsense happens and we end with one shit conversation about how dumbledore and snape were great men and we're supposed to believe that they're gonna be ok after this. that is of course until jkr decides she isn't done with harry's story at all, and writes another sequel where albus murders harry in 20 more years because it turns out their relationship never became better at all. who knows? i wouldn't put it past her. idk i just really don't know what to say, no one needed this, the last book came out in 2007, which is almost 10 years ago, and we didn't feel such a hole in our lives that a sequel had to be written and especially such a shitty one. I DON'T KNOW. i just don't understand. there are just so many ways to write something good but instead it seems like they just took the easy way and wrote straight up nonsense because they knew the fans would eat it up and buy the fucking books no matter what. well, as a fan: fuck you! and by the way, when you write something for money and not because you actually care about the characters, or that you have a specific story about them you need and want to tell, everybody can see it.(PS: if JKR doesn't want to write the story where Harry dismantles the oppressive system of the wizarding world that has allowed the ministry to be the shit that it's always been, i will, and in the meantime i will let harry take a well deserved break on a beautiful beach with his beautiful boyfriend. xoxo)To finish put an end to this horrific review (i'm so sorry) let me just say that i love my darling Harry, i don't care if he's fictional and i shouldn't love him this much, he's always been the realest and the most important for me, he means the world to me and he has saved my life in more ways than one. Even through this pile of shit he remains everything he's always been, the hero he's always been but also so much more than that; always so brave, always so ready to help people, always ready to do something horrible so that someone else doesn't have to, always blaming himself so people won't blame themselves, always trying to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders so that no one else will have to, always worrying over everyone even when no one really actually worries about him, and pretending he's fine so people won't worry, always kind, always trying to be better no matter what, always struggling with many things but still trying to overcome it, always trying so much, and always seeing the best in people, even when they don't deserve it, constantly hilarious, prince of freedom, and always and still such a good and beautiful person. So, Harry, my love, happy birthday, you are the light of the world, i love you all the time and always, and thank you for everything.

She's endorsing it though, which is more than enough for me, to be honest.Second, there's a 19 year difference since the original story ended. It's supposed to feel different.Third, it's a play. It's a flippin' script. It reads like a damn script. I don't get the fan-fiction correlation. It was never advertised or was ever going to read anything remotely close to the original story or like a full-fledged novel. Which script has good writing or feels like a fulfilling story? That's what the play is there for. Plus I highly doubt Rowling would allow for it to be absolutely butchered. Whether that's in the sense of the plot or the characters. I don't know what I was expecting going into this. I was terrified though, for sure, because the reviews were quite mixed, bordering more on the negative side. Thus, I expected nothing. Which helped. Massively. It helped me separate the original story from this script and I enjoyed it immensely. I enjoyed it for what it was. It was experimental and the dialogue was a lot of fun, though some parts of the story felt slightly far-fetched. It didn't bother me though. The nostalgia was more than satisfying and more than enough. It was nice to get a brief glimpse again into the lives of those characters who meant so much to us growing up.

I couldn't put this book down. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not a novel exactly. It is written as a stage play. So there are just dialogues between the characters. The story revolves around Harry's son Albus and Draco's son Scorpius. 
Positives:
Although Harry didn't sound like Harry.Hermione didn't sound like Hermione.Ron didn't sound like Ron.(view spoiler)[Snape didn't sound like Snape. (hide spoiler)]Hogwarts didn't look like Hogwarts.But.... I enjoyed the trip back to Hogwarts after so many years and meeting the shadows of Harry, Hermione and Ron.
Negatives:
I don't know its just me or others too have noticed that there was no J.K. Rowling in the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. It was like someone else wrote this book. Being a Potterhead and a fan of J.K. Rowling, I had a connection with J.K. Rowling and her writing style which I couldn't feel in this book. It lacks that essence of Harry Potter series, the very soul of the story that has kept us on the edge for years. Each and every book of Harry Potter series was a page-turner. After reading one book in the series we used to wait eagerly for the next. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child lacks world building. May be because it is written as a stage play and there are just dialogues. Perhaps a paragraph or two in the start of each scene defining the world around them could have improved the world building. There were not many great quotes in the book like there were in Harry Potter series - the ones we used to read several times and note down in our diaries.

In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.""    FEELS    First  Go into this with an open mind to fully enjoy it. It takes a little getting used to with the formatting and how it sometimes in the beginning jumped scene to scene. It's a PLAY. Although I read it like a normal book. I didn't picture a stage or anything like that. I was at Hogwarts and all the amazing places this story took us. And I was there with friends who've I've been waiting to fully meet for years like Scorpius and Albus..then I was there with people who have been in my life for years that I grew up with like Harry, Ron and Hermione. Jumping back into this world was such a joy and was like being wrapped up in a warm fuzzy blanket you loved all your life.   ""Those that we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch. Paint..and memory..and love.""   Another thing:  Remember. The characterization might seem a little strange at first but we left our favorites when they were 17 years old. They are ADULTS NOW. And we have some missing years which is up to us to fill in, in our own heads. Honestly it didn't bother me at all because they're still THEM. Harry is still heroic, Ron is still funny, and Hermione is still super smart. They're the same, just OLDER.   ""They were great men with huge flaws, and you know what- those flaws always made them greater.""   One last tip:  I read this like fanfiction. At times it seriously felt like the best fanfiction I've ever read..and I've read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction! Or read it like a script. And just ENJOY IT!!! Enjoy being back in the most magical places in the world. Enjoy being with your old friends and catching up with their lives. Because  it's truly something magical and special being back in this world.    ""People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are- and have always been- heroic in the really quiet ways.""  It's the story we've all be waiting for and its EVERYTHING. This picks up directly after the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. With Albus going off to Hogwarts and its his journey through mostly the 4th year of Hogwarts for him. And all the adventure it comes with. There's a lot of character development too and family bonding and friendship. Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy. And Albus goes through a tough time being known as ""Harry Potters son."" They have a pretty rocky relationship and it brings a huge turning point. There are SO many plot twists and a lot of old friends we get to see again. This book drags you through ALL OF THE EMOTIONS AND FEELS. I was a sobbing mess reading a lot of this!!! So read with tissues!!   ""Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We've been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we've blighted their present.""   If you love Harry Potter, you need to read this. Especially if you loved Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire!! I don't want to give up too much of the plot because I knew absolutely nothing going into it and I loved it. I really hope the play eventually comes to America and I'm always hoping we get more BOOKS!! Because I am never ready to leave Hogwarts fully!! Always remember though..   ""Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.""  *weeps into eternity*

does not need to exist.
Due to growing up in a religious household, I was not able to read Harry Potter until a couple years ago, so maybe I'm much less lenient with my rating because I didn't have the heavy nostalgia factor kicking in as I read through this atrocity. But really, publishing something this fanfictiony, for lack of a better word, is just a slap in the face to the millions of people around the world who have given this series a piece of their heart.A money grab if I've ever seen one.

   ""How many people have died for the Boy Who Lived?""   So....  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was a complete disappointment.  There were so many plot holes in this instalment and some of the characters were even OOC. Honestly, it just read like fanfiction instead of an actual, well-thought out story. WARNING: THIS IS THE END OF THE SPOILER-FREE ZONE. THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I'm going to address the elephant in the room which I'm sure is the first thing on everyone's minds: Delphi,  the child of Voldemort and Bellatrix.  I've always known (and accepted) that Bellatrix had an infatuation with the Dark Lord, but I always imagined it to be more of fanatical hero worship than a relationship with any sexual elements. The knowledge of who Delphi was threw me off for quite a while. Let's face it: Voldemort would  never  have had a kid. This premise by itself was already very off-putting since it was totally a huge leap away from Voldemort's character and personality in the original series.I loved seeing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny again; I was eager to see all the original characters and their kids. But I was severely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I was glad to see their cameos - but they were written so out of character that they didn't seem familiar to me any more. I'm a die-hard Potterhead - I read the series at 10-11 years old, and it's been more than 7 years and here I am, still as obsessed as I was the very first time. I've reread the books so many times and each time I open a Harry Potter book it feels like I'm coming home. (Hogwarts will always be my home.) But it wasn't like this with Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two. I was excited to see how Harry would turn out as an adult, an Auror, and a father - and let me safely tell you that Harry Potter,  who pined for his parents his whole life and was mistreated by his aunt and uncle,  would never treat his kid the way he did,  or tell his son he wished he wasn't his son. That line made me so angry. I nearly gave up my reread because of this. There's absolutely no way Harry would ever say that, given his own childhood and what he's been through. Add to that the fact that the other characters fell very short of my expectations. Ron was a flat, two dimensional character with bad humor, and I can barely remember any Hermione lines at all. I thought Albus Potter was rather whiny, overly dramatic and a little too attention-seeking for my taste. The only saving grace was Scorpius Malfoy. He was such an adorable cinnamon roll and for most of the time I wanted to hug him. Rose Granger-Weasley was a great character too, but she didn't get more than a few lines.I wasn't that bothered by the script format in this book, but it did have the adverse effect of making the setting less detailed (and as a result, less enchanting). In the Harry Potter books, the setting was described in amazing prose that captivated me, but there were no such descriptions in this book. The play wasn't difficult to read, but it just didn't have as much of a magical effect as the Harry Potter books.I'd have no qualms giving this book 1 or 2 stars, but I just can't bring myself to rate a Harry Potter book anything below 3 stars;  it would absolutely break my heart and leave me shattered.  (UPDATE: I've decided to stop being ""nice"" in my reviews and if a book deserves 2 stars I'll give it 2 instead of 3.) This series and these characters were literally my childhood and it's not something I can just casually give a low rating to, no matter how trashy the book was. I know I'm really biased but I'm still in disbelief. Like, jaw-dropping, eyes-glazed-over disbelief. What on earth happened between Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and this book?? The epilogue in Deathly Hallows was so lovely. It was such a beautiful closure all by itself. The fandom could really have done without this eighth instalment at all.

To me, Harry's story ended within the last page of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. 
The rest of the review contains spoilers for the original series and mild spoilers for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
Now, let's analyse the play together, since I am still pretty confused by a lot of things.• Harry's children. And no, I'm not talking about Albus, who will get a paragraph of his own, but about James and Lily. Sorry, what did you say? You found two personalities lying on the floor? Well, they must be theirs then, since they had none. What is even the purpose of James, besides annoying Albus all the time and being a clone of young James Potter Senior? • Albus Severus Potter. I just, I DON'T KNOW. Did I like him? I think I mostly liked the concept of him, the idea that he had been (view spoiler)[sorted into Slytherin (hide spoiler)] and that he was so much different from both his siblings and his parents. To Albus, Hogwarts wasn't the amazing place of friendship and adventure that it had been to his father. It was just school. There was homework to do, and there were bullies, and gossip, and rumors. And, constantly behind him, his father's shadow. I mean, I still think Albus seriously needs to get over himself, because he has the worst case of daddy issues I've ever witnessed, but that's somehow understandable. And he was still the only likable Potter in the whole play...• Harry. I mean, what? Seriously. WHAT? Disclaimer: adult Harry Potter is an asshole. I wasn't n. 1 Harry Stan in the original series either, but here he's just... oblivious, insensitive, horribly self-centered. Childish. Albus is a teenager, a child, but Harry seems to completely fail to understand this. He's overbearing, doesn't get his son at all, and just wants him to be a copy of himself, or - even worse - to ""be more like James and Lily."" He doesn't see him. And the end of the play doesn't change my opinion on this matter: Harry does not know his son. • Scorpius My Actual Son Malfoy. I'm sure we can all agree that he needs to be protected at all costs. All right, he's the least Malfoy person on earth, but he's still pretty adorable and dorky. I mean, who would've expected Draco's son to be a cute nerd? Well, not me, that's for sure. Still, even though I really liked Scorpius, his characterization is not canon for me. That's not my Scorpius Malfoy. I've always had a fascination with the more grey characters in the Harry Potter series, like Draco, and I like to think that Scorpius has some of that darkness in him, some of that selfishness, and ambition, but also the same fierce loyalty that Draco showed to his family during the war. To me, ""Malfoy"" and ""cute"" don't belong in the same sentence but, after all, Scorpius is still the reason why this play got an extra star. • Ron and Hermione. Again, what the hell? I know that, even in the original series, Ron represents the comic relief. However, that doesn't necessarily make him an utter moron. He was absolutely incompetent, and his complete inability to do anything at all besides making inappropriate jokes seemed to also have the purpose to make Hermione look more wonderful in comparison. However, this Hermione was... not Hermione at all. I only saw a glimpse of her in her interactions with Harry, but for the rest of the time, she was just a character with her name and a completely different personality. • Draco. MY BEAUTIFUL DRACO. Yes, I am one of those people, and I absolutely adore Draco Malfoy. Here we saw a softer version of him, a different version, but honestly - who cares. I just needed to see more of him. *blows kisses* *swoons*• I don't want to talk about the plot. It's fucking embarrassing how bad it is. Sometimes I even found the plot in the original series too convoluted and unrealistic, but this time it was just plainly nonsensical. Albus' reasons for doing things made no sense to me. (view spoiler)[And really, Voldemort has an evil daughter? What is even the point of that? And why does being Voldemort's child necessarily make her evil? She didn't grow up with her parents. She could've been a totally different person, her own person, but she was a cardboard villain instead, with ridiculous motives. (hide spoiler)]• The thing I liked the most, besides my beloved Malfoys, was (view spoiler)[the alternate universe in which Scorpius Malfoy was the Scorpion King. I know, everything was dark and bloody and twisted, but it was also a thousand times more interesting than the rest of the play. (hide spoiler)]I am done talking about this mess of a play, I really am. Can I unread it, please? Let's just pretend it never existed. I need to reread the original series and marathon all eight movies in order to recover from this.PS: I can't believe I've never asked, but what Hogwarts House were you people sorted into? I am, predictably enough, a Slytherin - and proud to be one.

The story in itself was very much the best part.But then there are things that I simply cannot accept as canon: the fact that Albus is worthless at Quidditch, the Trolley Witch turning into Edward Scissorhands, Voldemort and Bellatrix HAVING SEX AND PRODUCING A CHILD (I guess I also never pictured Voldemort's new body with the... *ahem* necessary parts), Cedric becoming a Death Eater because he was humiliated, and Hermione calling Voldemort ""the Dark Lord"" (only Death Eaters called him that - the magic lies in the details, folks) are only a few examples that come to mind. These things really bugged me.I did quite enjoy the script-form, though - it made for an easy and quick read. I imagine it would be nice to see as a play and watch everything come to life again.

I can't believe this is canon.
 I keep waiting for someone to shake me and tell me I was actually reading fanfiction because The Cursed Child is about 80% fan service.We have all the old characters back in play, all the old emotions and relationships are back to break your heart all over again.I will try to be vague here, but I have to say I was disappointed, in general. The writing is in no way on par with JK Rowling's usual brilliancy, nor was the plot. Everything felt hasty and a bit half-assed.However, I enjoyed the book's nostalgia factor and, as mentioned above, the fan service that made everything hugely entertaining.For specific thoughts, here is my spoilery review:(view spoiler)[I read this book together with my slash-shipper friend, at the same time in the same room, and we paused literally every thirty seconds and quoted the book at each other because we couldn't believe how much shipping material was contained in the pages. The reading experience was UNREAL.A few notable examples:Draco: (About Albus) ""You don't know what he needs. You only know he needs it. Find him, Scorpius. You two - you belong together.""God I ship this so hard.ALBUS (to Scorpius): ""As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years...""PLEASURABLE. He just HAD to use that word.Draco bounces Harry up and down on the table.I'm hardly even breathing anymore.He touches his son's shoulder. And the two of them - just slightly - melt together.Ummmmmmmmm...? Obviously I don't ship this but whaaaaat is with that subtext there?So THATS what I mean when I say ""fanservice"".I had lots of little issues with the plot.How come Harry was so out of character - he was horrible! He made both Albuses cry!Why was Delphi able to stay in the past for so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only works for 5 minutes at a time?How come nobody was looking out for potential saboteurs like Albus at the Triwizard Tournament?I refuse to believe Albus and Scorpius stole from Hermione without getting caught, or that Draco just had a Time Turner lying around at his house!If Delphi never went to Hogwarts how did she learn magic?Many plot points felt too easy or made little sense.I loved seeing some of my favorite characters again. I practically hyperventilated when Snape appeared. Draco had a very prominent role as a father and as his own person. We got a unique look at Draco's personality away from the war with Voldemort; in truth he's proud but compassionate and loyal. (Very ""Mr. Darcy"" of him.) Draco's definitely not a villain here.Most of the characters acted like themselves - the best example is McGonagall commenting ""I daresay it's my fault for owning a fireplace"" when everyone keeps ruining her carpet with floo powder. It was so lovely to reconnect with those characters again. Some characters however acted nothing like I knew them - Harry was a dick, and Dumbledore was an emotional wreck part of the time. I was very surprised.Cedric was a central point in the Cursed Child. Albus' quest starts with saving Cedric and the book closes with the acceptance of Cedric's death. The simple scene of Harry apologizing at Cedric's grave for getting him killed, for reducing his value to the ""spare"", was in my opinion vital to the Harry Potter series as a whole. The tragedy surrounding Cedric's end was never discussed enough at length in books 4-7. This revisit was necessary for closure.Am I alone in feeling like The Cursed Child didn't read like Rowling's work? Much of the play didn't achieve the plot intricacy and character depth I've always loved in Rowling's books. Besides that, Rowling has often said that if she could rewrite the series, she wouldn't pair up Ron and Hermione. Yet even in alternate universes of The Cursed Child, Ron and Hermione have feelings for each other no matter what. Why would Rowling write that, against her opinions? My theory is that someone else wrote most of the content for The Cursed Child and Rowling only edited. (hide spoiler)]Okay it's time to check out the mountains of fanfiction already dedicated to the play!

3.5 stars I'm still not really sure how to rate this one and to be honest I think it should have never been released as it slightly undermines the series.I think the play will be amazing and they should have stuck to only releasing a play.I did enjoy the story,mainly due to Scorpius Malfoy.I absolutely loved his character because he was just such a lil cutie and I loved the friendship between him and Albus.I also thought Draco Malfoy was written really well and loved how much he cares about his son and appreciates his wife.I liked Ginny's character as well especially because it was obvious how much she loves her kids.However, everything felt a little too convenient (view spoiler)[like how everything was so easily resolved and the whole mess with the time turner.Also, the whole concept of Voldemort having a daughter seemed a little silly. (hide spoiler)]The famous trio felt so out of character especially Harry,he was just such a dick to his child,Albus and I nearly had to keep reminding myself this was the same boy from the other 7 books.Hermione was just cold and Ron's character was completely dumbed down to this silly joker who never took anything serious and was only there to laugh at.I did love the view into the trio's children but I would have loved if they showed some more of the other children like James or Rose.(view spoiler)[The end with Scorpius asking Rose out was adorable although I would have preferred Albus and Scorpius together, especially because it seemed like they were hinting at it. (hide spoiler)]Overall I did enjoy the story as it's a simple plot and Scorpius is a great character but the famous trio were very out of character in my opinion.

It's gonna be hard to write a review for this. First because I'm not used anymore to writing my thoughts about books (look at my profile and see when was the last time I uploaded a review - or read a book, for that matter), and second because this was a much expected book of mine. I wanted to re-enter a world that made my childhood and even my teenage years. I didn't expect what ""another HP story"", if you're thinking that, but I was happy to be in that world again, if only to read some familiar names.So let's be clear: I liked the story... in general. The events that happened, and how there was some stage for character and relationship development. Of course, the writing didn't match up to it. I knew this wasn't written by JK, and that was much obvious. The writing was clunky, which could be owned to that fact, and to the fact that this was written as a screenplay, that is, this is meant to be watched at a theater, not to be read.That said, I was pleased to see some of the old characters we met in the HP series. Don't expect them to have a great role because this is not another HP story. The main character here is Albus, Harry's second son, and his friend Scorpius. That's as much as I'll say about the plot because my point here is not to spoil anyone.As for these characters I mentioned before, I liked them. I liked their friendship, and I kept guiltily shipping them. Why ""guiltily""? Well, because you know I'm not one who's on for romances in books, but come on, sometimes it's just necessary. (view spoiler)[Although I admit I was disappoited to see neither of them were gay... Sad, really, they would have made a good pair... What keeps me wondering is that they almost admitted having feelings for each other, yet they had their own girl-crushes... *shrug* (hide spoiler)]Overall, I think this isn't exactly disappointing, but I don't feel this was all that fantastic: sometimes the story felt awkward and forced, but I was somehow entertained. Still, I'd rather go read the HP series for the millionth time.________________________Should I start hyperventilating now or should I wait till I have it on my hands? In any case, I NEED THIS NOW.

What I was excited to read in the book:
1) Albus and Harry's relationship. I wanted to read about the kind parent Harry is supposed to be.2) Hermoine and her way in thinking and making great decisions, and Ron the funny but dependable friend.3) The Malfoys because Draco is one of my favorite characters in HP books after Snape and Harry -of course-.4) I wish the three kids were going to be friends! 
Writing-style:
I think this is the most disappointing part for me. I didn't feel Rowling's touch in the book this time! So, I feel she isn't the main writer for the book although her name took the biggest attention on the cover. 
Plot:
I won't talk much about it because it will spoil most of the book, but here we follow the main HP characters' children, Albus Potter, Rose Weasley and scorpius Malfoy. I liked the plot twists and it brought so many memories from the older books.But I expected more explanations. A lot of magic that happened was so unclear to me! Repeating the same scenes every time they (view spoiler)[traveled in time (hide spoiler)] was unnecessary to be written in the same way. I know this is a play but as a written book it is just so annoying.
Characters
1) The Malfoys, both Draco and Scorpius, were the best! Draco was an awesome father and I liked his friendship with Albus so much. The Malfoys never disappoint me! :)(view spoiler)[and I am so happy Snape is back again! ❤️ (hide spoiler)] 2) I loved Scorpius so much more than Albus. I don't know how to describe Albus, but he made me feel confused!3) This can't be Harry!!! He is the worst father! He just kept hurting people and that's not what I expected from Harry at all! I wanted to read about the brave kind Harry.

“Albus: No! I just wished you weren't my dad.Harry (seeing red): Well, there are times I wish you weren't my son.”

 

“Harry: Albus didn't like me before. He might not like me again. But he will be safe. With the greatest respect, Minerva -you don't have children-.Ginny: Harry!Harry: -you don't understand.”

This is not Harry, I swear.But unlike harry, Ginny was amazing.4) Ron here seems so silly, he just keeps telling jokes! But from other HP books he is a mix of a funny and a so dependable guy. That's how I feel about Ron from books or movies.- Now I believe it must be seen as a play!And I really wanted to have any chance to watch this as a play, it has to be so much fun than reading a play script.I don't want to read any other new HP books! I don't want to hate all the characters I used to love for a long time. I am sorry. I really tried to love this book more but I couldn't.

Yes I did.This book has been sitting on my shelves gathering dust for four years. I was hesitant to start this journey again. When I was young which was not so long ago, I listened to an interview in which J.K Rowling mentioned that she would not continue with Harry's journey. I raged after listening that. After all I didn't grow up with him but the time I had spent with him was magical. I didn't want my journey with ""The Boy Who Lived"" to end. But I learned to let go of my anger. I understood that some stories have to end. When this book was announced I remember the happiness i felt at that moment.But just after reading the first chapter I sensed that something was off. And so four years went by without me opening this book again until one week ago, by chance, this book fell on the top of my head as if reminding me that: ""Hey I'm Harry Potter! What could go wrong?. And I listened to it because it is Harry and what could go wrong?.Turns out a lot of things can go wrong.This is a pretty long review so fasten your seatbelts.*smol spoilers*
The Writing
This is a play. And it should be read as such. This should not be compared to Rowling's other work because they were not plays. But let me just say this: Rowling is a brilliant writer but a horrible playwright. I did not like the writing style at all. But between the conversations amongst the characters there are snippets of Rowling's writing that we saw in the original series. 

“Those we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch.”

Those conversations still held the brilliance and magic of the original series but a play is never meant to convey feelings. What we needed was explanation. For example: If Harry was behaving like this then we needed some explanation as to why he is like this? What happened to the boy who was compassionate? Who would have never said those things to Albus? We depended and still do depend on Harry's feelings and emotions. That is what we grew up with. Unfortunately, the worst idea was to transform this book into a play and as a result we are left with unanswered questions.
Dumbledore and Harry
This has been my favorite relationship in this entire series (along with ""Sirius and Harry""). I love their relation. And my heart is bleeding right now. 

""Of course I loved you ... and I knew that it would happen all over again ... that where I loved, I would cause irreparable damage ... I am no fit person to love ... I have never loved without causing harm ...""

I don't care what you say, I love their relationship. This was probably the best thing of this entire book.

""Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.”


Harry Potter
Hats off to the writers for destroying my favorite character. Anyone remember the compassionate boy? The one who forgave Wormtail? The one who let the person who betrayed his father go? The one who didn't use ""Avada Kedavra"" on his enemy? The one who pitied his mortal enemy that he couldn't have a chance at peace?Yeah that boy. He wasn't here. This isn't the same Harry. Allow me to quote Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

""He had it coming to him,"" said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother's voice, begging for mercy...""Parents,"" said Harry, ""shouldn't leave their kids unless-- unless they've got to.""

Parents he said. Tell me is this the same Harry? In this book Harry has a completely different character. Would the Harry we knew and loved, talk to Professor McGonagall like that?Would he have separated his son from his best friend?Answer: Never.*sighs*
The Golden Trio
Umm nope.The Golden Trio doesn't even exist. They don't talk to each other. Ron is there to supply humor. Hermione is not the ""brightest witch of her age"". Harry is too angsty and i don't even know what to say about him or the trio. Thanks again.#wtf.
Albus Severus
He didn't live up to the legacy of Dumbledore or Snape. The boy is a piece of s***. I mean just look at this:

""I didn't choose, you know that? I didn't choose to be his son.""

Yeah well he didn't choose to be your father either you maggot. I HATED him. Loathed him. He is awful. He has zero ability to think clearly. Just so he can defy his father the boy thinks it is a good idea to use the time-turner. And don't tell me the bullshit that he is young or whatnot. Spare me the details please. Harry was fourteen when he saw Cedric die. Then again not everyone can be Harry.
Draco Malfoy
STOP. PROVIDING. REDEMPTION. ARCs. WE. DON'T. NEED. THEM.Destroying the perfect animosity between two characters? Who gave them that idea? Yeah yeah school bully turned good. Guess what unless you can create a redemption arc as good as Prince Zuko's then stop providing them in less than 400 pages.

""Hermione Granger, I'm being bossed around by Hermione Granger. (She turns towards him. He smiles) And I'm mildly enjoying it.”

And there goes the time when Hermione SMACKED him. #disappointed^2.
Scorpius Malfoy
Scorpius is a cinnamon roll. He is the second best thing of this book. And can we take a moment to appreciate the conversation between him and Professor Snape? *d-e-d*

""Thank you for being my light in the darkness”

*sobs*
Delphi
I can only laugh at that. Seriously this was worse than the tomfoolery you would find at r/AreTheStraightsOk.
Rose Weasley
*le sigh*Hermione and Ron. When did they become so blinded that they, the people who were with Harry when he went through everything, forgot to tell their daughter that you don't go and blame people calling them ""Voldemort's son"". Thanks for the third time.
Unmentioned Characters
Where is Hagrid?What happened to Teddy Lupin?What happened to George?What happened to the other Weasleys?Did Hermione find her parents?What about Neville?WHAT HAPPENED TO HAGRID?
Verdict
Even though i had these problems, I still liked this book. I still had fun reading this. The nostalgia, the magic, it was all home. When Scorpius goes to the alternate timeline with Voldemort's rule I felt scared. When Snape was back I felt like angry at the world for being unfair.When Ron and Hermione face the dementors i felt like my heart was being ripped in two.When Dumbledore and Harry talk i was again reminded of the boy who lived in the cupboard under the stairs.It was a good book. Yes it did have many problems but it was a fun ride. The only thing the author can do now is to stop and leave this magical world to its readers for safekeeping.P.S: If you are disappointed in this book then please take time to watch A Very Potter Musical . It's truly the Musical Gotham Hogwarts/Harry Potter needs and deserves.

ORIGINAL REVIEW 7/Aug/2016 (5 Stars)I know a lot of people were really excited for this book but some people though that JK Rowling was over doing it and didn't know when to stop. Before I read this I thought this better not be a disappointment because Harry Potter ended perfectly and I didn't want this to ruin it for me. Before I read this, people told me to read it normally and not already love it because it’s a Harry Potter book. I tried to enter this book acting as if it wasn't written by JK Rowling but it still WAS AN AMAZING BOOK!!! Harry Potter is one of my favorite series ever and I honestly expected not to like this. This book so good! I wasn't even planning on reading it. Mainly because it was a script which threw me off but then I saw it a week ago and realized even if it is a script I still have to read it. You would think that because it's a script it's hard to visualize it all but because I've read the other book before it is so easy to picture it. So if you're worried that it's hard to picture it, don't be because even though it was a script I felt like I was just reading a normal book. (view spoiler)[My favorite book in the entire series is surprisingly not The Prisoner of Azkaban which seems to be everyone's favorite but is The Goblet of Fire. The fact this book incorporated part of it made it even better.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ I really liked the fact that Draco’s son and Harry's son were best friends. I really liked Scorpius despite the fact that he dad was Draco. And to be honest I didn't really hate Draco in this book.  (hide spoiler)]This book is actually so good and even though it's a script it still is so remarkable. It was perfect in every way. This makes me want to read all the Harry Potter books again. It was such a quick read and it ended quickly because it is a script. This book was spectacular and reading this really makes me wish I could have actually seen the play. Everyone should totally read it!!!

I think the epilogue to the original Harry Potter series, found in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", was a masterful finale to the saga. It gave readers a hint of the adult lives of Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione, as well as a glimpse of their children. It suggested the adventures that had occurred in the intervening 19 years without spelling them out. It was a marvelous ending, with just enough tantalizing information given and just enough details withheld to leave me closing the book with satisfaction. Rowling intentionally allowed the future of Harry and the wizarding world to remain a limitless void--one readers could fill in with their own imagination. I like this kind of ending, it makes me feel like a partial trustee to my beloved characters' futures.I was hesitant to read “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” with its claims to be ""the eighth Harry Potter story"". I thought it was a desperate attempt to fill in that artfully crafted void with a story driven to make a profit from loyal fans. But as fate would have it, a friend from work begged to differ, lent me her copy, and hoped I would change my mind. To summarize this review, I still stand by my previous statement. Before I get any violent reaction, please remember that this is how I personally feel about the book. This doesn't mean you shouldn't read it or automatically dislike it.The book, actually the script of a play by Jack Thorne, is based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, and co-authored with John Tiffany. The hero is Harry’s second-born, Albus Severus Potter, who turns out to be the exact opposite of everything the wizarding world, including Harry, expects a Potter child to be. (view spoiler)[ Albus is sorted into Slytherin instead of Gryffindor, is hopeless at Quidditch, and befriends Draco Malfoy’s son, Scorpius, instead of other, more suitable companions. The rest of the book charts the unlikely friendship between Scorpius and Albus, and the father-son tension as Harry and Albus struggle to relate to each other in time for them to protect the wizarding world from disaster. (hide spoiler)]Although Thorne tries to reawaken the magic of the first seven books, the attempt seemed clumsy to me, with awkward pacing, far-fetched scenarios, poorly developed characters, and out-of-the-blue plot twists. There’s comic relief, but it’s an awkward, uncomfortable shadow of the witty repartee Rowling furnished her characters with in the original series.(view spoiler)[ I also sensed a bizarre sexual tension between Scorpius and Albus that felt painfully forced. Random scenes in which the boys appear to be growing closer are dropped in and left undeveloped. (hide spoiler)] The pacing is exhausting and the plot twists are over-dramatic and implausible. Of course, this was not a play written to be a reading experience in and of itself, but frankly-- the main story drops too many dungbombs every few pages, to the point where they’re hardly exciting for me anymore. Dramatic information is put in at awkward places, and more geared to keep viewers’ eyes glued to the stage than to actually create a well-crafted narrative that meshes with the tenor of the previous books. As the story continued, I found myself only mildly interested by each new development, and mostly just imagining the authors brainstorming together, gauging just how far they could take the story without going completely off the rails.Nevertheless, “Cursed Child” did remind me why I loved the original Harry Potter books, even if it failed to really return me to that world. There are thoughtful, well-written moments akin to those of the original series, like when the trolley-cart witch turns out to have a second role in the Hogwarts Express, or the parts with Severus Snape. But Rowling herself was right when she said after the release of the seventh book that she ended “Deathly Hallows” in the elusive way she did because“...within a novel, you have to resist the urge to tell everything.” Unfortunately, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” tells a little too much. If you’re itching to read it, go ahead. If nothing else, it successfully provides an hour or two of nostalgia and might remind you of just how much better the original series really was (I'm planning to read them all again). But to all of you who haven’t read it yet, don’t bother dishing out your galleons buying a copy. Just borrow the book--or see the play, it might translate better.

I wish I would've re-read the other HP books before this...not to remind myself of details, because HP is the one series I could never forget. But just to fully immerse myself in that world again for a longer time. Will have to do a re-read of all 8 sometime soon with a movie marathon thrown in there.This was amazing! I'm so happy that the script was made available as a novel. I thought I would be a bit thrown off with it being a script rather than a proper novel. And I did miss the amazing world building and the fine details that were always a part of the HP novels. But, I had no trouble getting into the story and visualizing it (Is it weird that in my head, all the characters look the exact same...no time passage or growth?)I wish I could have been in London to see this play, though with how much I ended up crying, it would probably have been slightly embarrassing.I'm not going to go into details at all about this, because I don't want to spoil anyone who hasn't yet read it. Just know that this is a must read for any true Harry Potter fan.

""I is a good elf""It's been proven three times now, that I always get ahead of myself when reviewing Harry Potter, incorrectly concluding the last one (out of the ones I've read so far) to be the best, but it cannot be helped. The standards are moved up - again. It's like Rowling just had a look at the first books, found them to be way too short, and came up with this one, which is much longer than the previous ones - combined! And the writing style keeps on improving, while plot getting more and more thrilling, making it oh so delightful to read.""Will you please inform zis 'Agrid zat ze 'orses drink only single-malt whiskey?""It's great to have that feeling of 'how easy it is to read everything is' still being part of the author's narration. Though the events are being described in much more detail, it does not take away anything in terms of interest. On the contrary, the reader is kept well in suspense, with a number of twists, without making anything too unreal (relative to the world of magic that is). I don't recall ever being more immersed in a book than this one (again, I'm probably getting ahead of myself).""Alf-giant? Moi? I'ave - I'ave big bone!""As far as the environs go, I think it's safe to say that we've arrived at darker times, toward which the third book made way for. Though I loved the first three 'relatively-trouble-free' years, this one is certainly more interesting with so much happening, while introducing a whole new set of interesting characters. And the occasional humor complements nicely without distracting the reader too much.I don't think I'll be able to rest well until I'm done with the series. I kind of feel sad about the readers during original release years, who had to wait year after year for the next book. Must've felt being under 'Crucio'.""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.""

This was the beginning of my addiction to POTter. I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called ""experts"" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don’t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn’t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already ""been there done that"" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn’t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling’s breezy, “ear friendly” prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It’s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

Thanks for riding along with me!

“Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.”So this quote kind of sums up what “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire” was really about and I think it was cleverly done. ;-) As always there’s so much to talk about and I decided to continue with another of my “My thoughts about this book” reviews. For HP this seems to be the best solution because otherwise I’d end up writing 5.000 words essays and we all know that 1.) Goodreads won’t let me post them and 2.) No one would even want to read so much! *lol* So random thoughts it is! 1.) ”Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said Bill.I found it really odd that the term “Death Eaters” was mentioned and explained for the very first time in here. I mean Voldemort and his Death Eaters are one of the first things that come to mind when you think about HP. I thought it would have been mentioned in one of the earlier books already, but nope, it really was the first mention. Knowing the Death Eaters will accompany us for the rest of the series this was kind of shocking. XD2.) ”I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs Weasley said, starting to sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get enough O.W.Ls? Oh, Fred... George...”Mrs. Weasley is legit one of the best moms ever and you can feel her love for all of her kids including Hermione and Harry. So yes, this a Molly Weasley appreciation moment and I still think that she is one of the most underrated characters in the entire series! I love that woman! <33.) ”Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?” said Hermione scathingly, and she, Harry and Ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily. Hermione clearly found her self-confidence and poise after “The Prisoner of Azkaban”. XD I loved how she always retorted comments that were thrown at her. She’s so smart it was a pleasure to see her stand up for herself! (and others) And yes, I admit it, just like Ron I wanted to hold the memory of Malfoy the bouncing little ferret in my mind. *lol*4.) ”How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you’ve never seen? A wizard who’s about to put an illegal curse on you isn’t going to tell you what he’s about to do. He’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face. You need to be prepared.”Ahh Mad-Eye Moody! As much as I agreed with a lot of the things he said, I also disagreed with a lot of the things he did. Does that even make sense? XD For me Mad-Eye is one of those super morally grey characters because he sometimes does bad things for “the greater good”. Then again his character is consistent too because as an Auror he saw what dark wizards are capable of and he’s totally right when he says that they won’t play nice and fair. Guess I’ll always feel conflicted about him. 5.) ”Neville, are you all right?” said Hermione.“Oh, yes, I’m fine,” Neville gabbled, in the same unnaturally high voice. “Very interesting dinner – I mean lesson – what’s for eating?”Neville will always break my heart. That poor boy deserved so much better than he got and I’ve such a soft spot for him. He’s another of those Hogwarts characters I really would have loved to read more about and no matter what people think: He is brave and a true Gryffindor! <36.) Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no difference.”And here we have another reason why Snape can’t be redeemed. He’s just nasty and mean to his students and a real bully. No matter what happened in his past, he should know better than to let his students suffer for it. I still think that movie Snape is way nicer than book Snape and if you only know book Snape you know why I don’t like him. I might understand his reasons, but I still hate him. >_<7.) ”Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would break.“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.I love Dobby so much! <333 He’s such an adorable and sweet guy and it was so good to see him so happy! He’s probably the only house elf that appreciates his freedom but considering his former masters it’s no wonder he’s happy to do what he wants. *lol* Guess you’ve to experience the Malfoy’s as your masters to truly appreciate freedom. ;-P8.) ”Oh, I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you’re going to take the best-looking girl who’ll have you, even if she’s completely horrible?”“Er – yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.*sighs* I usually like Ron but I never liked his “Goblet of Fire” version and I still don’t. I mean yes, he’s a teenage boy who’s going through puberty but that doesn’t excuse the many horrible things he does and says in this one. To say it plainly he’s a total dumbass in GoF and I really don’t like him. At least in this book. First he doesn’t believe Harry and then he’s hurting Hermione whenever he opens his mouth, just because his teenage hormones apparently make it hard to think before he says something. We could blame it on puberty but I think there’s so much more going on... Luckily Hermione is clever enough to see through it. 9.) ”Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished.”And here’s another breadcrumb that will be relevant in the next book. XD You gotta love how Rowling scatters them in the earlier books and makes use of them later on. ;-)10.) ”If you really want to know, he – he said he’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me, but he hadn’t been able to pluck up the courage!”So after three books we dive right into the teenage drama and angst. Which is kind of suitable for their age but boy, did it impact their friendship in this one. I think from now on there’s no book in which they don’t have a conflict of some sort. No matter if it’s Ron/Harry or Hermione/Ron. There always seems to be something brewing between the trio. And bless Victor Krum for realizing how beautiful Hermione is! If none of the two boys at her side can see it, at least Victor can! I think he knows her value way more than her closest friends and I really appreciate him for it. =)11.) ”Trying to ruin someone else’s life?” said Harry loudly.Harry giving Rita Skeeter a piece of his mind is one of the best things in this book. That woman is horrible and she’ll only get even worse as the series proceeds. Harry’s got guts to confront her directly and I just love him for it. 12.) But Sirius shook his head and said. “She’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron. If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”And here’s another character I’d love to see more of! Sirius Black is one of the best and I loved how protective he’s of Harry! He’s like a lion protecting his pup and I lived and breathed for it. After everything Harry went through he deserves someone who loves him and stands up for him. Even if it’s against Dumbledore because he wants Harry to rest and feel better instead of recounting events. Sirius placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder and defending him against Dumbledore’s questions really made my day! Best guardian ever!13.) ”Yes,” said Harry. “Professor – I was in Divination just now, and – er – I fell asleep.”He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was coming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite understandable. Continue.”Haha! As much as I disliked Dumbledore forcing Harry to relive that horrible night I still can’t help but love him for his attitude. He’s one of the best teachers ever and the fact he didn’t even bat an eye when Harry told him that he fell asleep in Divination. Priceless! *lol*14.) (view spoiler)[ ”And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason – he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort’s feet... he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defence was possible...”I LOVE Harry so damn much, I can’t even! He’s one hell of a brave boy and I can’t even imagine how terrified he must have been. Yet he still refused to back down and didn’t give Voldemort the satisfaction of seeing him cower in front of him. This moment shows the true Gryffindor in him and why he got sorted into the house. When push comes to shove Harry always does the right and noble thing! <3 My precious boy!  (hide spoiler)]15.) (view spoiler)[ ”Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered – it seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to bring him back to his parents...”“That’s right, Harry... just let go, now...”This moment always makes me cry! Cedric Diggory’s death is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in this series and it will always break my heart. No matter how often I read it, it’s still devastating. And Harry’s reaction to it, knowing that he could have been alive if he would have touched that portkey without him... It’s the first time that he has to live with the death of someone he knew and liked and it’s even worse because he feels guilty. What if he would have done the egoistic thing and won the tournament? What if he wouldn’t have offered Cedric to win together? For the first time ever his sense of fairness and his honour brought death to someone and his feelings are so complex I could cry. He did the right thing but it ended badly and left him devastated. If that’s not the symbolical embodiment of growing up then I don’t know. (hide spoiler)]16.) (view spoiler)[ Professor McGonagall went straight to Harry.“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry. “Come along... hospital wing...”To see McGonagall show so much emotion about broke me. This woman is always so composed and knows exactly what she’s doing but for the first time ever she can’t seem to be able to ignore her own feelings. She cares about Harry deeply and it never showed as much as after Cedric’s death. Such a great and beautiful scene!  (hide spoiler)]17.) (view spoiler)[ ”Fail to act – and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!” Well, and that’s about exactly what happens. Fudge didn’t take Harry’s story seriously and the wizarding world had to pay the price for his ignorance. It’s kind of eerie how Rowling captured politics and how the fact that they work so slowly is standing in their own way. At first Fudge didn’t react and once he did, it was too slow to make a difference. He kind of dug his own grave with his actions at the end of GoF and history will indeed remember him as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort to take a second shot at power.  (hide spoiler)] “The Order of the Phoenix” is up next and it’s the last book I have to borrow from the library because I actually have book 6 and 7 in English at home. =) So let’s hope I’ll be able to borrow book 5 soon. ____________________________________I always forget how serious those books become.“The Prisoner of Azkaban” was already very dark but I think “The Goblet of Fire” stepped it up a notch. The ending will always get me, no matter how old I am. >_<Full RTC soon! Stay tuned!P.S: I borrowed this twice from my library. *lol* That’s how I was able to continue. Thankfully they have a lot of copies of HP! XD____________________________________I just borrowed this from my library but of course someone else already preordered it again. >_<So I guess that means I’ll have to be fast and start now!617 pages with a super tiny font. I CAN DO THIS!!!Or well, at least I hope I can. *lol*Regardless of everything I just said “The Goblet of Fire” has always been one of my favourite HP books. I’m curious if I’ll feel the same way after rereading it now. Which HP book is your favourite and why? =)

I know what you think: Don’t I have anything to do instead of rereading 750 paged long book on my weekend. Of course I am: I could try to cook breads, cakes, muffins or any other carbs involved project and share at my social media account to risk myself turn into Thor’s big bellied image at last Avengers movie for consuming them incessantly like my most friends do till the quarantine ends (it will end eventually, right?) Wait a minute, I cannot do that! I can only pose with burned or overcooked things if I insist to cook. I can also resume home soccer matches with my husband dearest but there is nothing left called glass at our place and I am still stressed walking barefoot because there may be still a tiny threatening glass piece hid somewhere waiting for me! And of course: After Ozark, La Casa Da Papel, Tiger King and Unorthodox, I couldn’t find any appropriate content match with my taste. I’m already working on three books but on weekends: I’m suffering from melancholy and I prefer to do something make me happy in the past. ( Like keep watching Shaun of the Dead, Big Lebowski and Fight Club. Interestingly at your each rewatching séance, you’re catching another detail!) I already told third book is my favorite because it was the last piece that my three musketeers keep their innocence till they take their first steps to the dark side.And this book is the beginning of the dark side. This is the middle part of long installment. A big death will shake them to the cores and everything about their life will change forever. This is one of the darkest, more action packed, gripping, thrilling but also heartbreaking book of the series. When I first read it nearly 20 years ago, I didn’t get intimidated when I see the page numbers. On contrary I felt blessed because normally I have been finishing a Harry Potter novel in a day (At least I finished the first three books in one day! Correction: First book took me only half day. Thanks to my fast reading technique I improved at college years!)Book’s longevity was great news. I could spend more time in Harry Potter’s world!After reading the whirlwind Quidditch Cup competition parts, I adored blooming creativity and visionary scenes written by JKR. I went back to my younger, dumber self and remembered the times how I cherished the chapters, how I thrilled when Harry succeeded and how I flabbergasted after reading the shocking ending.I adored it again and I promised myself to read it another 20 years later. ( I hope I won’t be at quarantine next time)I recommend you to read the books give you time travel to your happy times at the past so you can handle the daily terrors and find the strength to carry hope into your near future. That’s why JKR is one of my all time favorite authors!

Towards the end of this fourth book in the Harry Potter series, my little girl had difficulty falling asleep. I had to defuse the situation.The Quidditch World Cup is coming, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have the chance to watch the final round, before the start of the new school year. This time problems start even earlier than the end of the summer vacation, far from the walls of Hogwarts... Many pages, many events, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the Triwizard Tournament, the tasks to face. There is always something to understand, some mystery to unveil. Great food for our ""potterian"" curiosity. But be warned, Dumbledore warns us:«Curiosity is not a sin. But we should exercise caution with our curiosity...»Caution... easy to say!Vote: 9«Gli abitanti di Little Hangleton la chiamavano ancora Casa Riddle, anche se erano passati tanti anni da quando i Riddle ci abitavano»Forse stavolta ho esagerato con la lettura serale per mia figlia. Non tanto per la mole, quanto per il contenuto, più cupo dei precedenti. Verso la fine di questo quarto libro della serie, la mia bambina aveva difficoltà ad addormentarsi. Ho dovuto sdrammatizzare non poco.La Coppa del Mondo di Quidditch è alle porte, ed Harry, Ron ed Hermione hanno la possibilità di vedere dal vivo la finale, prima dell'inizio del nuovo anno scolastico. Questa volta i problemi si presentano ancor prima della fine delle vacanze estive, lontano dalle mura di Hogwarts... Pagine dense di eventi e di nuove conoscenze, tra cui il nuovo insegnante di Difesa dalle Arti Oscure. E poi il Torneo Tremaghi, e le prove da affrontare. C'è sempre qualcosa da capire, qualche mistero da svelare. Ottimo cibo per la nostra ""potteriana"" curiosità. Attenzione però, Silente ci avverte:«La curiosità non è un peccato. Ma dovremmo andarci cauti, con la curiosità...»Cauti... è una parola!Voto: 9

(the complete opposite of info-dump) & I believe it's a talent.& here it's about the first war & You know who's followers & rituals.We're also about to see the Quidditch World Cup (Fudge was so funny here!) & getting more information about the magical educations around the world.the plot; we knew something were off, but we can't exactly pinpointed it until the end when the truth revealed. Rowling knows how to reveal a plot twist in the most shocking way. (she actually proved it a few times in book 1, 2 & 3! but still surprising how brilliant it is.)Harry's suddenly in trouble & he doesn't know how.I like Krum.& all the predicaments the Trio should struggle through made by Rita Skeeter, bullies & the mean students, but they didn't cower or hide, they held their head high & ignoring them.I always loved villains in disguises, they are interesting & cunning & we can't tell until they revealed their secrets. the feel of bewildered betrayal the hero going through.the writing style is fun as always, comparing to book one, it has improved a lot, now it's graceful & rich.the villain's chapter was the best villain-ish/not-Harry-related POV in the whole series; intriguing & spooky.the movie was good, but didn't do the justice toward the book, it felt so rushed & deleted many parts of the book.I would've liked to see the Quidditch World cup Final match on the screen, the real ""interesting"" 3rd task & the Sphinx, the hilarious scenes by Ludo, Dobby, Winky & her story or showing the stubborn stupid refusal of that gargoyle to accept the truth & the cleavage in the society in the end.& while fans are angry about ""Dumbledore asked calmly"" part that turned out the total opposite in the movie (& I totally LAUGHED at that part everytime I reach that moment in either the book or the movie), I'm MAD at how movie Harry acted out-of-character in one scene in the movie (just because increasing the thrills I suppose) when he did exactly the opposite in the book.

This last fourth of the novel has always been my favorite. Voldemort's return! That scene with the Death Eaters! Harry vs. Voldemort! Moody isn't Moody! Rita Skeeter exposed! It's all wonderful. GOBLET isn't my favorite in the series, but it's still pretty damn magical.

The summer is dragging and Harry can't wait to join the Weasleys and Hermione at The Burrow and go with them to the International Quidditch Cup final. It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year will be different to the previous ones, for Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament, a competition which hasn't been hosted for a century. A contest involving two other international magical schools and three dangerous tasks, only students of age are allowed to compete in. Harry is looking forward to watching the games and supporting whoever the Hogwarts champion is. What Harry doesn't expect is finding himself entangled in these dangerous events. For me this is where the story really picks up. The games, as well as the dark atmosphere make this book so compelling. You can't help but want to know what happens next and how Harry decides to face all the challenges that come at him. “If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.”The introduction of foreign wizards/witches in this book sets this one apart from the others. I absolutely loved seeing how different they are to the usual British magical community. And the rivalry that is usually present at Hogwarts between the Houses is amped-up. I really felt for Harry. He faces hate from the other students for something he had no control over as well as being shunned by one of his best friends. I don't know how he deals with everything honestly. “It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”Our trio are growing up. I loved those scenes with Harry and Ron struggling to communicate with girls 😂. Their sudden awareness of the female population was so sweet. I always associate this book with magical Christmas-sy vibes. It just felt a lot more enchanting than the previous books in this series.

4.5 stars I really don't think I need to tell y'all that I loved this because I've been raving about this series since the moment I started it back in January but for the sake of clarity - I love this.  I believe everyone (even people that have no attachment to it at all) has a Harry Potter story under their belt. Whether it be the story of their first time reading it or the time they convinced everyone in their family to dress up as the Weasley's or when their Potterhead teacher made them play Quidditch in gym class, everyone has some kind of HP story they whip out at dinner parties - this is mine. Back in my early teens, after a childhood of ignoring the wizarding craze under the guise of my idiot-self being too sophisticated for magic (yes, 8-year-old Grace was an asshole - that isn't the story) I was a camp counsellor. But I wasn't a counsellor at any ordinary camp, oh no, I was a counsellor at a theatre camp. Each year we would put on a different musical and the year I was 15 it was decided we would do a child-friendly, dumbed down version of the Goblet of Fire, complete with all your favourite musical numbers stolen straight from A Very Potter Musical. I played James Potter, helped countless kids memorize their lines, choreography and ten musical numbers and yet the only plot points I picked up of the entire musical was the Yule Ball and (view spoiler)[Cedric Diggory's death.  (hide spoiler)]The whole time I was reading this book - 5 years later - all I could think about was that musical and what I knew was coming because of it. I was worried the entire novel and utterly heartbroken once it actually happened - 5 years of build up to finally understanding what was happening in this book and I'd say It was 100% satisfying. This book is masterful; it is the book where everything changes and you feel it with every flip of the page. It maintained the classic spirit of books 1-3 while perfectly balancing the added stakes and darkness. Also, like every other installment the way everything that is revealed at the end answers all your questions and puts all the more new ones straight back into your head was just as satisfying as it was the first three books and it was perfection. I want to curse 8-year-old Grace for being an idiot and 15-year-old Grace for not paying attention at work because, boy oh boy, do I wish I read this series sooner.

Here I am in March 2020. It is day eleven of isolation and no school or work for most of us. I have four kids all learning by phone conference call or online chat, all on slightly different schedules, and I am here utilizing my education degree in case anyone needs clarification on an assignment. I wish I did not have the opportunity to put my education degree to such hands on use. Under normal circumstances, I would be gearing up for another baseball season and preparing for Passover, the dual rites of spring, but 2020 is hardly normal. With a new temporary normal upon us, I decided to reread Harry Potter along with two of my kids, who are embarking on rereads of their own. As the series grows progressively darker, there is also the underlying presence of hope. In these dark times, we all need a daily dose of magic in our lives, and, like an old friend, Harry is there for us. If Harry Potter were real life, Harry and his friends would be moving onto high school after completing their first three years at Hogwarts. With important discoveries at the end of their third year that penetrate magic at its deepest reaches, Harry is about to begin his fourth year of his magical education. Dark forces are gathering, as had been predicted throughout the first three books. With his servant returned to him, Lord Voldemort is determined to rise again, more powerful and lethal than ever before. Harry senses that something may be amiss because his scar, his connection to Voldemort, has bothered him over the summer. Reaching out to his father figures, it is apparent to all that Voldemort is gathering strength, and Harry represents the best chance to conquer him; that is, if he can get through a year at Hogwarts complete with teenaged love and angst and new magical tasks awaiting him as he furthers his education. With these forces both inside and outside of Hogwarts building up, determined to do Harry in, the fourth year at Hogwarts figures to be the most dangerous one yet. With summer vacation nearly over, Harry returns to his friend’s Ron’s house named The Burrow to see the final of the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling introduces readers to new characters at every chance she has, starting with the eldest Weasley brothers Bill and Charlie. Ron has always been conscious of the fact that he is a youngest brother, and now we see that Bill and Charlie have indeed been successful since leaving school. This theme of it measuring up to either Harry or his brothers stays with Ron for the rest of the series, and undoubtedly for the rest of his life. Here the family is at its magical best from the twins inventing jokes to the fully qualified wizards using their wands to perform mundane everyday tasks. We find another form of transportation, a portkey, an everyday object that allows the user to be teleported to a new location instantly; of course, a portkey will reappear later in the book as Rowling does not introduce minor characters or items unless they have a purpose later on. The scene in the movie while the kids look so innocent traveling awash in color contrasts how their lives are about to change with these dark forces conspiring to overtake the world. The color and innocence of childhood is about to end, and then Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and their contemporaries return to another year at school. Professor Dumbledore introduces the Tri Wizard Tournament to be played against champions from two other wizarding academies. One must be seventeen to enter by placing their name in the goblet of fire, which is guarded by Dumbledore’s age line. Fred and George would love to enter as the winner receives one thousand galleons, which they would love to start a joke shop; even they are no match for Dumbledore’s advanced magic. Somehow, someone who wants Harry dead places his name into the goblet of fire. Although only fourteen, Harry is now bound to participate along with the other three champions. His friends and enemies show their true colors as the tournament progresses, those aligning with him as a beacon of hope and those who support the other Hogwarts champion while also being staunch pure blood wizards who are eagerly awaiting the return of Voldemort. The tasks in the tournament, which include battling dragons, Mer people, and various magical creatures and hexes pale in comparison to the constant fear that would blanket the wizarding world should Voldemort return to power. Harry, exhibiting the mettle that has allowed him to overcome Voldemort on multiple occasions, represents the best hope for both the tournament and defeating Voldemort again. Here as the arc of the series reaches its apex, it is obvious that Harry will be destined to fight Voldemort again. The education he receives during this fourth year will be crucial down the road if he is to win that battle. Rowling interjects light moments throughout the book as well: Fred and George’s determination to create jokes, Ron and Hermoine’s growing relationship which comes to a head at the Yule Ball, the foul reporter Rita Skeeter. Readers acquire more magical knowledge as well. Dumbledore siphons his thoughts into a basin called a pensieve. This object will continue to play a role throughout the series, but here we learn about the trials against Voldemort’s supporters during his first downfall. We find new information about Neville’s family as well as Professor Snape, and wonder whose side he is really on, something that isn’t resolved until the end. Hagrid notes that whatever comes, will come, and Rowling notes that the division within the magical community between those who value pure blood and those who value ability are more pronounced that ever. House elves and giants play a prominent role, dementors bide their time to rejoin Voldemort, and Sirius returns to play his role as Harry’s godfather to the best of his ability. Sirius’ presence throughout this book tethers Harry to the magical community more than ever as he is there as a mentor and father figure, taking his place as the family Harry never had, and reminding Harry the need to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Three long books remain. As I am at home with more time than I anticipated to read this series, I may finish sooner than later. It is always bittersweet as I reach this turning point in the series, as Hagrid tells Harry to brace for darker days ahead, just as we are doing in real life now. My kids and I are here for the long haul, both in our new reality of 2020 and on Harry’s journey to eradicate darkness. We will cheer his triumphs and shed some tears as friends succumb to dark powers. Even though this may mirror what is going on in real life, at least for those hours that we are immersed in Harry’s world, we are experiencing a world other than our own, a world full of magic where one person gives us hope that life will be righted sooner rather than later. 5 stars

I found myself constantly holding my breath towards the end, there were so many twists and turns! I have actually seen the movie version before, but I forgot much of it, so I was extremely surprised at some of the reveals. The build up towards those situations was just perfect!I loved that we got to see a bit more interaction between muggles and wizards in the beginning, as well as more scenes outside of Hogwarts. It was a nice change and helped bring a bit more realism to the story (it was nice to see that wizards and witches get excited over such a normal thing as a sport event, too!).One of my favorite things in the book was the portrayal of friendship. Harry, Ron and Hermione were depicted as normal teenagers, who sometimes just happen to fight over the stupidest little things. I feel like that really brought their friendship forward, in a way. I, in general, feel like there was a lot of progress and development in the book. I haven't read the following books yet, so I obviously can't say how much of what happened in this one will play a part later, but I still feel like I learned so many new things about the world this story takes place in and about the characters in it. And oh man, how much I just love those characters...

Once again, I listened to the audio book and the narration was fantastic. If you’ve never read the books before, or your a long time fan- I highly recommend these audio books. The narrator does a fantastic job. I love getting lost in the world of Harry Potter and can’t wait to read more <3

On one hand, I liked the book, but I didn't love it, but on the other hand I felt like I couldn't give it less that 5 stars because I wouldn't be the kind of woman I am today without this series. This series changed me and when I look back at the old version of me, I feel I don't really recognize that girl anymore. So yeah it was pretty complicated for me to rate this book. I think the reason why I didn't love it because I knew what would happen, so the shock was not there anymore. But then I loved the second and third book. hmmm, It's pretty confusing when I think about it. basically, I liked this book but I didn't love it.
Cedric Diggory's death
I cried you know when he refused to take the Triwizard Cup and he told Harry to take it. He was just so good and noble and when Harry told him to take the cup together, I was grinning while crying at the same time because I was so proud of Harry's decision. BUT I STILL CANNOT ACCEPT HIS DEATH. He didn't deserve that kind of death. I really hate Voldemort and Wormtail. They deserve a painful death and may them rot in hell for all the evilness they have done. Honestly, I still can't believe that there are death eaters who actually support Voldemort. Like what the fuck? Voldemort is evil and so freaking bad. 
Snape Being Mean To Hermione
I do not hate Snape but there were moments where he just left me gaping with disbelief on my face because he acted pretty mean and annoyed me. For example is the moment where Harry and Malfoy were fighting and they tried to hex or curse each other, but Malfoy's spell caught Hermione and Hermione's front teeth became longer. Like very long until they passed her collar but then when Snape saw them, he said 

Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, 'I see no difference.' 

I was shocked when I read that part because what did Hermione do to deserve that kind of response? that was just so mean. I felt sorry for Hermione right away in that scene. I wanted to say to her that ""it's okay, the teeth can be fixed and Snape was just being bitter.""
The Morning Before The Third Task
I really love the Weasley family with no exception. Percy is my least favorite though. This book is indeed a reread for me but I did not remember at all about this scene where Harry was told to meet his family before the final task and I totally did not know who would come because the Dursleys couldn't possibly come, so who's this family? and then when I realized that it was Mrs Weasley and Bill, my eyes suddenly became teary. It was so clear that Mrs Weasley, Molly, cared and loved Harry. Harry is so lucky to have the Weasley family. They're such a nice family and come to think of it, how can Malfoy mock Ron's family? to me it's so absurd. The Weasley family is a great and I adore this family. Thank you for reading and liking this review! I really appreciate it and I hope you all have an amazing weekend. ❤❤•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••5 STARS
"" Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust, Differences of habit and languages are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open. ""

My Opinion
OMG!! This book! lot of things happened and I'm still in shocked. okay let's begin with Cedric Diggory. 
My Most Saddest Scene
Cedric was a nice guy and he was really sweet and I liked him. I was so shocked when he died because I thought he would be alive until the last book and he died so fast that I just sat on my bed and I was like "" What did just happen? "" I still can't believe he died in such a young age and it was all because of Voldemort. Oh! and I was so proud of Harry too! he's so kind that he suggested Cedric to hold the cup with him, So there would be two winners not only Harry or Cedric and I was so confused who I wanted to get the cup first, I liked Cedric but I also liked Harry. So I was very happy when Harry suggested that but that happiness vanished as fast as it came. The cup was a portkey and the cup transported them to Voldemort and Cedric died so fast that I didn't even cry. I was just so shocked.because what would Harry say to his parents?! and I was so worried what about if they blamed Harry for this ?!? but thankfully that didn't happen. Cedric's parents were very sad but they didn't blame Harry. They even thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them. 
My Favotite Scenes
I think there is something change between Hermione and Ron.Ron was so mad when Hermione went to the ball with Viktor. He said it was because Viktor was from Drumstrang and he said Hermione was fraternizing with the enemy. But I still don't believe this at all. Before Hermione went to the ball with Viktor, Ron liked Viktor so much that he even wanted to get his autograph and I think he acted like that because he was jealous. hahaha. it was so funny and sweet to see Ron got jealous and there's also this scene : 'Known what?' said Ron quickly. 'You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?''Don't be stupid,' Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. ' No, it's just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?'Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. 'What?' said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.'He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,' Hermione muttered. 'After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to -''And what did you say?' said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. 'and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,'Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, 'but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an invisibility Cloak, maybe she sneaked into the grounds to watch the second task ...' 'And what did you say?' Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard it dented the desk. 'Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were OK to -'but before she could finish that sentence Snape came. Ugh. why did he have to come when she hadn't finish it!?!? but that scene was sweet and funny wasn't it?! AHH MY HEART!!
The Plot Twist
 The plot twist in this book was better than the plot twist in first book, second book and third book. I swear I didn't expect that at all! I thought the bad guy was Ludo Bagman because he acted so strange. He asked Harry whether he wanted his help or not and so I thought he was the bad guy. then there was a scene where Moody was the bad guy but he wasn't Moody. he was the imposter of Moody and the real Moody was imprisoned in his own trunk and this imposter was Barty Crouch's son. Thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you all have a great weekend! ❤❤❤

Book Review

4+ of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the 4th book in the ""Harry Potter"" young adult fantasy series, written in 2000 by J.K. Rowling. Although this one was close to a 5 for me, I think it's enough to give 1 book in the series a 5-rating, which means this one will stay at a 4. But I still loved and adored the characters, the setting, the story, the themes... all of it! Rather than go into a detailed review, as we've seen too many of them (always fun to read tho!), I'm just going to chat a little bit about the parts that I enjoyed the most.1. The selection of the 3 students to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's scary to think the schools condone putting the kids at such risk, but then again, I suppose they'd stop it just before anyone died or was hurt irreparably. To imagine the goblet of fire choosing one from each school, and then Harry's name being cast as a fourth one... fantastic idea and approach. I felt the drama. And I loved having him put to the test mid-way thru the series... as he never seemed to be all that good of a student or a wizard!2. The introduction of new characters in this one is intense. I loved all the folks at the various stages of the competition. To see feelings emerge for one another, to know they were going thru the same unrequited love and anger we all go through as teenagers. Was a good experience -- I thought it was one of the more real aspects of the series.3. The imagination for all the tournaments and the dance... fantastic. I wanted to be there watching it all happen. I can only imagine how it felt to write those scenes... knowing it would propel the characters forward in a very different path by the end. And to see the drama of how it all turns out.I am feeling the need to re-read this series again soon...

Re-read - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire steps up from the previous ones very well, it's the darkest book I've ever read since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Who knows ? Harry Potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibility on his shoulders, he never wants to be selected, he never wants glory and prestige, yet the world turns against him anyway.I love that this book isn't a children's book anymore, in my opinion, it becomes hastily intense and has more dimensions than J.K. Rowling had ever intended. She did a great job when she wrote this book, I could see her intention for the book to be a mature one and she made the right decision for doing that. I'm so pround of her and so she becomes my favorire author EVER !
“If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.” 

“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.” 
Not only this book is full of adventures, but it hides some messages for you to discover. Isn't it the best way to teach our children via books ? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has everything I've asked for since the first time I read. Until now, the book is like a gem and I think of it as my treasure because it's so precious my eyes hurt to look at.Many things happen in this book such as a tragedy and deprecation, but it's the way our lives go on, right ? So I embraced this book like a teddy bear and told myself that perhaps something really bad would happen, but it's just mishaps and it would pass like a rainy day.
“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”

(Disclaimer: I am on Hour 26 post-wisdom teeth surgery, on some painkillers no one should turn their nose up at, and desperate for solid food and human interaction. So in other words, bear with me, because this may be...somethin’.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Okay, let’s start with our characters. I always gotta discuss the same collection of several. Both Harry and Ron are pretty consistently eh characters for me (except in the first book, in which I really enjoyed Harry). Here, instead of being eh, I found them...annoying? It drove me absolutely insane that Harry kept procrastinating his clues - like no yeah, do your Divination homework the night it’s assigned, but please put the life-or-death clue off to the side for now. And don’t even get me started on their constant, needless bickering. Ugh. HOW ARE YOU BOTH SOMEHOW EQUALLY ANNOYING HERE?Neville, on the other hand? Cemented his status as a fave o’ mine. His backstory is great. He really deserves to be in Gryffindor, the brave li’l guy, and I just want to give him a big hug. Snape, meanwhile....Well, somehow he outdoes himself here. I just don’t know how I’m going to hold onto this rant until book 7. God, you guys, get ready for a tsunami of anger, I guess.And let’s discuss that feminist message, shall we? I, first off, love that my perhaps-all-time-favorite character Hermione gets political as hell in this one. Mad respect, girl. And for a cause that she’s laughed at for, even one that would make her life far, far easier in every means if she just backed off it! (I’m seeing some parallels to feminism here….) Plus, her defeat of Rita Skeeter, who taunted her for her appearance and reduced her meaning as a person to the boys she spent time with, is just amazing.And don’t even get me started on the representation of women in professional sports in this book! Fabulous enough that almost half of the Gryffindor quidditch team is female, but the fact that there are women competitors in the Quidditch World Cup? Amazing! There’s no underestimating the empowerment that representation lent to young, female readers who dreamed of being athletes.If only this wonderful treatment of women - and we know that Rowling is a tried-and-true feminist - extended to the Triwizard Tournament. But alas, all we get is...Fleur. Fleur’s only trait is her beauty (cough cough, reminds me of someone we know, cough cough, CHO F*CKING CHANG), she (like Rita Skeeter to Hermione) is reduced to the boys she spends time with/thereby must be flirting with (Cedric, the Ravenclaw quidditch captain), and, worst of all, she’s not a good competitor. She gives an eh performance in the first task, receives pity-points in the second, and is ignored and eliminated in the third. Ms. Rowling, my love, couldn’t she at least use her looks cunningly to distract her opponent? If you were only going to give us one girl competitor out of four, couldn’t she at least be, well, good?There were fewer stupid mistakes in this one, but there were still some. One being that somehow magic-less mermaids painted pictures of themselves on a rock...underwater. Unless they’re sourcing that fancy schmancy under-da-sea paint, they should not be able to do that. Also, the search for Sirius is never mentioned by the many (many, many, many, MANY) members of the Ministry of Magic we are CONSTANTLY seeing in this book. Or by Rita Skeeter. Which doesn’t make sense, because that search was a big f*cking deal. (And don’t you think ol’ Skeeter would want to bring up that failing when she’s writing inflammatory articles about Hogwarts and/or the Ministry?)But this comes down to the same thing all these reviews come down to: the world. Goblet of Fire gives us the biggest look into the Wizarding World since Sorcerer’s Stone (Quidditch World Cup! Triwizard Tournament! The operations of the Ministry of Magic!), and because I love looking at this world so flippin’ much (plus fewer teeny errors) I have to give this a high rating.Bottom line: definitely better than the second and third, and maybe (MAYBE!) an almost-tie for favorite-so-far with the first one. The feminism contains some mixed messages, there are a couple things that don’t make sense, and I still haven’t found a way to kill a fictional character (but when I do, watch your back, Severus). But the world, Hermione, Neville’s story, and a couple other great things overcome all that. This book rocks! Hurray!

I found it entertaining and really enjoyed all the inventive ideas around magic that Rowling comes up with. I kept saying to myself, ""why didn't I think of that?""The character development is interesting too as Harry is clearly heading into adolescence and having issues with girls. The Yuletide dance scene was absolutely the best part of the book, I thought. And, for the francophones reading this review, the French translation misses entirely the sly humorous French and Eastern European accents that Rowling uses for the Beauxbatons girls and the Durmstrang boys which were hilarious! That being said, I was a little disappointed with the Fleur Delacourt character from Beauxbatons. As the only girl among the four champions, she totally sucked at all three challenges. Not a very encouraging model for French girls or girls in general. I mean, I know Harry always has to win, but perhaps it would have been a wee bit better and even more suspenseful if Fleur had placed a bit higher. A note about the movie: it was FRUSTRATING! The movie skipped easily half of the book or more - no quidditch at all :( - and I don't know how folks could have followed the action without having read the book because to my eyes, there were a lot of nonsequitors (like the poor editing of the death eater scene following the Quidditch World Cup.) I definitely would recommend reading the book if you only saw the movie. Far better!

So what broke me?Firstly, the plot holes. Well, more accurately, one plot hole, but it was a frackin' doozy. You know the opening scene in Star Wars where the camera is beneath the belly of the Star Destroyer and the shot just goes on and on for about ten frackin' minutes and you can practically hear George Lucas yelling ""That's right, Star Destroyers are REALLY BIG, bitches!""? Well, this was a Star Destroyer sized plot hole. (view spoiler)[ Rowling goes to some length spelling out that portkeys can be anything. A cup. A book. A fluffy bunny. She also establishes that you can't teleport in and out of Hogwarts, because it's warded. Fair enough. BUT, Harry and his chums have often left the grounds of HG's, to go and drink 'butterbeer' or buy living chocolate frogs or snog in alleyways or whatever. The precedent has been set that they can and do leave the school grounds. FFS, Harry lived outside of Hogwarts for YEARS (and yeah Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru's [or whatever] place was magicked so folks couldn't find him, but how did he get back and forth to it, eh? A TRAIN.)SO, you are an evil overlord trying to take over the world. You need Harry's blood to get your body back. You have an agent WITHIN Hogwarts, despite all these magical defenses, disguised as a teacher that Harry implicitly trusts.Do you:a) Set in place an elaborate ruse, framed around this enormous tri-wizard tournament, which (presumably) is under scrutiny by the most powerful wizards in the world and the ministry of magic, in which you manipulate events so that Harry not only enters the tournament (despite rules that expressly say that he's not old enough) but wins it, touches the tri-wizard cup, which, despite all these defenses and wizard-y scrutiny and security, you've managed to turn into a frackin' portkey (yes, you're that good) so that he gets teleported away from the tourney grounds into your evil clutches and hey, you bleed that bitch.b) Have your agent (who Harry implicitly trusts) say ""hey Potter, what's say we head down to the pub for a mug of butterbeer and I'll tell you some stuff about your dad/mum/long lost twin?"" use all your evil-wizardyness to change a mug of butterbeer into a portkey, and save everyone around 400 pages of this book.Sorry, but I didn't buy it. I've read many fan arguments explaining why the tri-wizard tournament and everything around it wasn't window-dressing on an overly complicated plan, the fruits of which could have very easily been borne by a far less convoluted and complex Evil Scheme(tm) which, granted, probably wouldn't have made a very interesting book, but YOUR WAREZ, I AM NOT BUYING THEM. (hide spoiler)]But second, and more importantly, it was in GoF that I realized that Harry was going to win. That he was just awesome, and no matter what rules were set in place (you're too young to enter the tournament/you're ten years old, why on earth would we put you in the CLUTCH position on our Quidditch team/you wear glasses, the ladiez don't dig dudes in glasses) he would triumph. Rowling LOVED Harry. She loved all the Harry gang. Too much. And it became painfully obvious that these kids were going to win, without a single fatality/crippling sacrifice/crushing loss. That in the end, Voldemort would be beaten, and Harry would marry Ginny, and Ron would marry Hermione and everyone would live happily ever after and make lots of adorable wizard babies.This was the book Harry ceased being a character and became a caricature. A SUPERHERO. Superheros bore me. I want torment. I want LOSS. I want my heroes to pay a TANGIBLE and TERRIBLE price for their victories. And no, killing tertiary characters doesn't count. (view spoiler)[Digory? The Weasley twin? Even Dumbledore (yeah I know he dies, I got spoiled) is disposable.  (hide spoiler)]I need to believe my heroes could fail. I know they probably won't. I know the good guys will eventually win. But I need to be afraid for them. I need to be scanning the faces of the MAIN characters and wondering ""which one of you will be dead/emotionally crippled/hideously disfigured before the final act is over?"" And I never believed for a second that Rowling would harm a hair on their heady-head-heads.(view spoiler)[And, turns out, she didn't. :P (hide spoiler)](shrugs)

“Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
This is where everything changes: from the last chapters of this volume onwards, Harry Potter gets dark and stops being a series of childrens' books. This is the last book where the wizarding world is most of all a place of wonder and fascination and not a world threatened by darkness. And this is the book where Harry himself stops being a child.
“Don't talk to me.""""Why not?""""Because I want to fix that in my memory for ever. Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret...”“Who're you going with, then?"" said Ron.""Angelina,"" said Fred promptly, without a trace of embarrassment.""What?"" said Ron, taken aback. ""You've already asked her?""""Good point,"" said Fred. He turned his head and called across the common room, ""Oi! Angelina!""Angelina, who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire, looked over at him.""What?"" She called back.""Want to come to the ball with me?""Angelina gave Fred a sort of appraising look.""All right, then,"" she said, and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face.""There you go,"" said Fred to Harry and Ron, ""piece of cake.”
There are still moments like these, there's still a lot of Hogwarts innocence and there's also the embodiment of teensy romances, the Yule Ball, but this book is darker. Right from the start when Harry witnesses the murder of an old muggle and wakes up because his scar hurts, we know that this is darker. Trelawney's propecy from Prisoner of Azkaban is unfolding itself, and we know, right from the moment Wormtail turns that chair in the Riddle's old home around, that this will not have a happy ending - and that more murder and darkness is coming.
“What would come, would come...and you would have to meet it, when it did.”
But before we come to its terrifying conclusion, this book introduces a lot of new information about the wizarding world. Where we only got glimpses of it other than Hogwarts and Diagon Alley, there are far more details here: the Quidditch World Cup introduces international wizards, the highly objective Rita Skeeter articles introduce the importance of the media, and the Triwizard Tournament (the most useless spectator event ever!) introduces other magical schools. Regarding the tournament: just why would you plan it like this? Apart from the first task, the spectators just sit there and stare at the Black Lake and a maze without having any clue what's happening inside. I mean, come on. Why would you do that?Anyway, apart from the word-building, lots of new characters are introduced, from Beauxbatons schoolgirls to gruesome Death Eaters. While Voldy is still the big antagonist, we get to know a lot about his followers here: one wizard alone can't be a serious threat to wizardkind, not even one as powerful as Voldy, he needs followers who are just as evil as himself. So this is the book with Bellatrix Lestrange and all those other lunatics in it, the one with the Death Eaters' past crimes. Poor Alice and Frank.
“Dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.""
If I look at this series, this is probably my least favourite one apart from Chamber of Secrets, because there was so much useless stuff happening: all of those people treating Harry like shit because his name came out of the Cup, the big Harry vs. Ron clash, the Yule Ball and all those hormones flying around, and the sheer unnecessary complication of Voldy's nefarious plan -I mean, come on. Why make it this complicated? Of course, I still love it. I love how it all comes together, I love the ferret-scene, I love Harry's extraordinary bravery in that graveyard, and I love the intensity of all of it...five stars.----So. The thing that really freaked me out during my last reread of this was Percy Weasley. Weatherby. Whatever. Gimme a break, Percy, will you? Percy's ambition is relatable, but everything he says and does just makes me want to punch him in the face. Repeatedly.

Now THAT'S a book! The groove that J.K. Rowling starts to find in HP 3 is fully realized in 4. Partly it's that the kids (and therefore the readers) are getting older so she can delve into more adult, complex themes and situations, and partly it's that I think she's really finding her voice. We finally got our very own HP's, I am happy to report, and it's so funny to look at them all side by side b/c of the HUGE leap in size between 3 and 4. Then they get a little tricky b/c while 4 and 5 look to be about the same length, the font in Order of the Phoenix is much smaller, hence a longer book. I just started that one and it honestly feels longer already. More of a book book and less of a fun afternoon's diversion. But I like these books as they get both darker and longer.But to focus on Goblet of Fire specifically for a moment...again, not that I think I can bring anything new to the table in discussing these books. Nevertheless, I'll throw a few ideas out there just for your reading pleasure. One thing that struck me, as I mentioned before, was the increasing maturity and complexity of situations and themes. Clearly having someone die is a huge deal and I found that whole series of events really moving this time around. I may have last time as well, but I don't remember. In a way, though, some of the more complex issues feel jarring next to the goofy concepts she originally created. Calling non-magical people ""Muggles,"" for instance. It's just a stupid word and yes, it sounds funny and makes kids laugh, but sometimes it's hard to take all these people seriously. ""Mud-bloods"" on the other hand is vicious and definitely drives the point home. I just wonder if she was to do it over again if some of those terms or ideas would change a bit. Yes, we'd all like to revisit what we did/wrote when we were less sure of ourselves and our voices and ideas, but of course we can't and neither can she. And what do I know? She claims she always knew what would happen to Harry, so maybe for her ""Muggle"" is the ideal word.Since, as usual, I find it impossible to discuss the books without referencing the films, let me just say that although I hated Dobby in the movie (2?) and was glad to see him mostly cut from subsequent screen incarnations, I really loved him in this one. The dialogue is actually quite funny and Hermione's whole S.P.E.W. thing just cracks me up. Yes, I know a lot of people hate it and find it annoying and whatever, but I love it. Of course she would have a cause like that. That's who she is! And poor Winky. They're weird creatures (and OH how I love Kreacher in the next one!) and I can't decide whether I am with Hermione or everyone else on their ""plight."" Either way, I like that they exist; they provide a bit of moral ambiguity in a world that is mostly cleanly divided between good and evil. You might wonder about people, but for the most part they end up squarely one or the other. Other than Snape - another great piece of moral ambiguity whose complexity grows from book to book.I also continue to marvel at Rowling's ability to write about the teenage mind. Ron and Harry's fight is spot on, as are Hermione's various reactions to it. And oh these poor boys having to ask the girls to the feast. I wish I had known when I was in middle school how truly hard it was for boys to talk to girls like that. Although I probably wouldn't have cared, being the good self-involved teenger that I was. I still want to go to Hogwarts.

TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN. TRANS MEN ARE MEN.

Her comments have caused me so much pain and disappointment and even if one day she realises how ignorant and hateful she has been it is now too late to amend the harm she has caused. Nevertheless, like Daniel Radcliffe said the relationship between a reader and a book is sacred and nothing can change that. Harry Potter is no longer hers and I will continue loving and cherishing this world and these characters forever (and yes, I will be re-reading the series and watching the movies time and time again during my lifetime). However, I can no longer support her or her future work. Rowling is TRANSPHOBIC and supporting her in any way, shape or form supports her views and harms trans people and the LGBTQ+ community profoundly. I cannot take back the money I have given her already, but I can choose to never again spend money that will go directly in her pockets. I want to use this space to encourage everyone to support trans authors and read more literature featuring trans characters. This page is a good place to start.Please consider donating to a trans charity of your choice (MermaidsUK could be a place to start, because they have been directly attacked by Rowling) and click here to find about more trans organisations in the UK and what you can do to help. If you still love Harry Potter that’s okay but stop supporting Rowling and stop putting any more money in her pockets. Let’s all actively work together to make this fandom inclusive to everyone and show trans people especially that we are a loving community who would never question their identity or experience.

Now this is one of the very very few times that I have watched the films before I’ve read the book (no judging here) and out of the four books so far this one has the most differences, but the book was so much better!There’s such a dark atmosphere to this, and I was often questioning what was happening. I adored the backstory of Crouch and his family I was just like WHAT IS HAPPENING! While this is getting darker there are still fun moments, my favourite being Pigwidgeon what a lovable little owl! Not only this but we got more glimpses of Sirius and I loved how protective he was over Harry. This is the first glimpses I’ve seen in to Ron and Hermione have jealous spats and not only that but Hermione starting S.P.E.W (SPEW?!).What I liked?- The Quidditch world cup, I loved that everyone had to dress up to try and pass as muggles, also the mascots of each teams were an added bonus- Hermione calling Malfoy a “Twitchy little ferret” ahahahahahahaha!- Nifflers!- The Pensieve and seeing all of the memories, it was so well done.- Everyone coming out of the wand!- Dumbledores speech for/about Diggory. My heart!- Rita Skeeter and all of her little secrets!- THE BUILD UP WAS SO GOOD!What I didn’t like?- Friendships being broken for such a long period of time… - Some parts seemed to drag ever so slightly for meOverall I didn’t expect was how emotional I found everything?! I mean I was close to tears at some points which I was very surprised at.

➽ book 2 out of 100  Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.  I can’t write a proper review about a Harry Potter book so instead here are some things I love about Goblet of Fire:➽ The Triwizard Tournament and it’s champions. This is truly the most exciting backdrop for any of the books and why Goblet of Fire was my favourite when I first read them.➽ Seeing Dobby again! One of the things I hate about the dramatic Dobby moment in the seventh film is that we miss out on so much amazing Dobby content from this book. Dobby is seriously one of the most generous and entertaining characters that you grow to love so much throughout the series that the strictly movie-watchers miss out on. The S.P.E.W moments and the scene where Dobby gives Harry the Gillyweed is such a missed opportunity for the film!➽ The complicated character that is Barty Crouch; and in the back story that Sirius provides us we get to have an important discussion of the difference between “good” and “bad” people and the lines that get blurred during times of chaos and panic. I feel like this was a wonderful piece of foreshadowing to Order of the Phoenix and the corruption of the Ministry and Umbridge that we’re about to encounter?➽ The scenes in the pensieve are some of the most exciting scenes in the series and such an excellent way to tell backstory. Witnessing Karkaroff betray the fellow death eaters, Ludo Bagman in the height of his Quidditch career and of course the haunting trial of Barty Crouch Jr. Honestly those scenes are this series at its best.➽ The entire  Priori Incantatem  chapter.➽ “Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time.”➽ Our main antagonist is finally here on the page in full form. This is truly where the series ramps up for me. I cannot wait to reread the rest of these books immediately.youtube ❀ twitter ❀ instagram

This is the first time that a non-titular character in Rowling's work becomes the main character, crowding out Harry, Hermione, and Ron altogether! He even crowds out the plight of the house elves!All Hail Barty Crouch!Ahem. Sorry. I've been under the Imperius curse. For a long time. Sorry. In fact, it's been almost the entire length of this novel. I just broke out from under it only to find that my place is a mess and there are approximately 365 pairs of socks draped over all my bookcases. (Don't ask.)I loved this book more than the movie, alas. I especially loved all the times under the Veritus potion where we get a full breakdown of events from Barty's PoV, obviously, and to a lesser degree, the House Elf Liberation Front. I feel for you, Hermione!And, of course, I miss the fact that Harry's winnings in the Tournament went to the twins. I thought that was brilliant in the books and inexplicably missing in the movies. Seriously! I want to hit something! Or at least curse it.If you haven't read these books, shame on you. If you have, you feel me. Right? :)

Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts. His enemies still want to kill him (what else is new?) and this time they use a very elaborate scheme to do just that. Poor Boy Who Lived have to fight ever more difficult challenges on the top of his ever more difficult classes.In case somebody still did not get a clue that the series left children book territory in the end of the previous book, this one begins with a chapter seemingly taken straight from an adult horror story instead of showing Harry's misery with his life with his adoptive parents as was always the case before. The said misery starts in the second chapter. This novel is also practically as big as the first three put together.The structure of the book looks strange if you stop the (exciting) read and think about it. The beginning and the end of it are quite gloomy and contain some horror elements while the middle part is actually quite humorous and lighthearted at times. Surprisingly it actually works. We finally got to see other schools of wizardry, their headmasters and some of their pupils. Some new fascinating (both in good and bad sense) and important people are introduced. Some interesting people/creatures are back (go Dobby!!!). Good people die. No resolution is in sight by the end and the situation became much worse than it was in the beginning. Somebody mentioned that in this book the reader gets to live in Hogwarts; I missed this the first time around rushing through all the excitement of the events, but I noticed this during the reread. The freaking School of Wizardry feels alive and real! This is not a small feat of the author. This is also the reason I gave the higher rating this time. Harry Potter: read it; experience it; live it.

The dates for my listen this second time are almost the same as last year which was unintentional and I'm oddly pleased about it! I was especially troubled by Moody's months long imprisonment in his own magical trunk - - it's a terrifying prospect. ORIGINAL REVIEW - - SEPTEMBER 18TH 2020:I have always loved these books and have always found that there is something about them that holds up well to constant rereading. I feel like I get more from them each time, as a fresh perspective mixes in with an overwhelming dose of nostalgia and I get completely caught up in stories that are so familiar but still feel new and exciting as well. I actually got a copy of this book for my seventh birthday, so it felt quite fitting that I spent a portion of my birthday twenty years later listening to the story. It's interesting how things can work out like that, even if it is just a simple thing. I used to carry around my hardcover copy pretending it was a spell book, muttering spells of my own invention to myself. I also have a paperback copy that is missing pages after I lent it to someone who damaged it (lesson learned!) and has a blood stain on the page where Frank is listening to Voldemort and Wormtail -- I think I gave myself a paper cut, though I can't recall for sure now.  I still have memories of reading this book at my Nana's house (not on my birthday). I had been enthralled all day, and the third task was absolutely gripping --- I loved it. And then Harry and Cedric decided to touch the cup at the same time, which seemed perfect. I kept turning the pages, ready for cheers and school pride, and things took a shocking turn. I can still recall the jolt I felt when Cedric was killed, so unceremoniously, so off-hand. I hadn't seen the movies yet (they may not have been made) so everything was still the way I pictured it. Now I can't help but add touches of Daniel Radcliffe or Ralph Fiennes to events (though I keep the red eyes from the novel for Voldemort), or David Tennant, who looks nothing really like the book describes but is so good in the film that he has kind of imprinted into my mental image of Bartemius Crouch Junior, overriding whatever I imagined before.   So, Cedric was dead, dark magic was done and I tried and failed to get to sleep. I ended up having to resume reading. I think I finished the book that night, exhausted, frightened and enthralled. It astounded me that things this time didn't really wrap up neatly. There was no return to safety. The Wizarding World had irrevocably changed and Fudge didn't even care! Or cared in the wrong way, about the wrong things. He doubted and blustered and downplayed. I was shocked. Harry had witnessed murder and betrayal and brutality and nothing could make that OK. It may have been the first book that really, truly shook me, and although I already loved books, it was Harry Potter as whole, and the darkness of this one in particular, that made me realise how vital and real a fictional story could become. I think this was also the first one where I had to wait for a long stretch of time to read the next. I couldn't save up, borrow from a neighbour or beg for a gift because it wasn't out yet. So, of course, I reread and reread. The first four books are my most worn for this reason. Thankfully I was a fairly careful child, so my copies are still readable, though certainly a little battered.When I be started listening to the series as read by Stephen Fry I don't think I was quite prepared for what an emotional experience it would be. I knew I cared passionately about this world and it's characters, but I think I had forgotten just how much. Returning to such loved books ended up feeling especially calming during this time of a pandemic and the stresses that come along with that! It's been nice to disconnect from that and focus on books when I have the time. Everything I have read in recent months has made for a welcome distraction, but Harry Potter in particular. Seven things really struck me this time, not significant or insightful observations, just the things I thought the most:1). Bill is so cool. A wizard who dresses like a rock star (I kind of merge any musician that seems actually cool into my mental image of Bill, though of course Domhnall Gleeson is in the mix too!) I've always loved Bill. He's probably my favourite Weasley ---- or at least tied with the twins. And Charlie. 2). Krum is so sweet and may actually be my favourite character of the book. He's a superstar who is quite nice. He loves Hermione and isn't a prat about it. He's clumsy and brilliant and I loved Stephen Fry's take on his accent. In the movie they make it visually obvious that he is under the Imperius Curse in the Third Task, but although it's a chilling shot, I wish they hadn't, because the entire point was that you can't tell when someone is under its control. If everyone's eyes were so obviously clouded, you could just look at someone and discern whether or not they are making their own decisions. In the book, Harry and Cedric are not sure why Krum acted as he did. Harry only finds out later. The mystery is vital. 3). Cedric, or rather, Cedric's ""echo"", asking Harry to take his body back to his parents really upset me. I knew it was coming, but it still made me cry. I think it's because Cedric used to seem to mature and grown-up, but now I realise he was very, very young. I was going to say 'was a child' but that feels a bit condescending. Young man. 4). Neville and his parents. Everything about this is so painfully sad. I'm both looking forward to and dreading everything about this that comes in the next book. 5). Dumbledore feels more powerful in the books than the films I think. In the movies it's a lot of being told how powerful he was, and we don't really see it until the end of the fifth movie (in a rather brilliant battle scene) whereas I feel like the books more effectively build up just how incredible he is and some of the tougher elements of his personality come through earlier so feel less abrupt. There is this edge to him that is present in the later parts of this book that show he is much more than this friendly, eccentric old guy. Though he is that too!6). Wormtail's blunder, Mr. Crouch's insanity slipping into moments of lucidness, and his murder at the hands of his son felt really eerie. It felt just as creepy and sad as ever. Also, later when Crouch Jr. says that his father loved his mother, I just found that particularly touching. Crouch (Sr.) can feel quite villainous but that detail does humanise him. Everything about his family situation felt horrifying, and I had a great deal of sympathy for him. I think he saw his son clearly, but can't help wondering if his lack of care for his child made him more vulnerable to Voldemort. Nature, nurture or a mix of both? 7). Winky and Dobby. I love them. I don't think Winky was in the movies(?). I remember I was really looking forward to seeing her, and her little outfit, and Dobby's outfits, especially the tea cosy, and feeling quite disappointed by their absence. I know things had to be cut, but Dobby featuring more here makes everything that happens later even more poignant. I'm really looking forward to starting Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix soon. I know some people don't, but I've always loved the angst, anger and brooding that comes along with that one!

I liked it and I know what happens, it was really fun and even a bit shocking to see a twist after twist at the end like that. The book as a whole was really good, I didn't like the very angsty teen moments, I hated that these kids grew up and now they all want to date and stuff but I also liked that some things were challenged like the friendship Harry and Ron have, also side characters like Neville and what happened to his parents.It's not what I expected in some ways and it is in others, I definitely still prefer Chamber of Secrets of all the books but this was good.------------------------------------------------Buddy read with Snape's wife 😂

Rowling’s emphasis here is much less on school life (not a single inter-house Quidditch match!) and much more on the wider wizard world and, simultaneously, on Harry’s more narrow, personal world.

The death of the Hogwarts student causes nary a lift of the reader’s eyebrow; the complicated explanation for Voldemort’s infiltration of Hogwarts is fairly preposterous and impossible to work out from the clues given. The characterization, as well, seems to be getting thinner, with Dumbledore in particular reduced to a caricature of geniality. What’s the connection between Harry’s and Voldemort’s wands, between Harry and Voldemort himself?

The Potter adventures continue in a series that keeps outdoing itself with each novel I read. What began as an interesting story about a boy wizard has me completely hooked and demanding more as I delve deeper into the darker side of magic. J. K. Rowling does a masterful job at penning a story that has something for everyone, in her first story that really expands on the foundation she has laid and develops things into a much more thorough storytelling adventure that will test the determination of any reader, young or old. Some have said it is the best of the series. Based on the novels I have read to date, I must concur. Newer fans of the Harry Potter series, I can only hope you are ready for an adventure of a lifetime, as Rowling pushes you headlong into an abyss you will enjoy exploring.It’s the summer before Fourth Year and Harry has been counting down the days until he can leaver the Dursley house and return to Hogwarts. However, his friends, the Weasleys, have a surprise for him before he hits the books. Mr. Weasley has secured a handful of tickets to the finals of the Quidditch World Cup. This means an early departure from his family who hate him and the chance to see the best athletes in the Quidditch world. While the game is all that Harry and the many other fans could have hoped it would be, Voldemort and his Death Eaters make an appearance, causing havoc to everyone in attendance. Harry grows quite concerned and his ever-present scar aches, perhaps a sign that evil is on its way.The return to school provides Harry, Ron, and Hermione with a new surprise when they learn that Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament; a competition between the three top wizarding schools across Europe: Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons. Difficult challenges that promise to test the skill and daring of a ‘school champion’ from each scholastic establishment will provide some camaraderie, but also could prove deadly, if past tournaments are any indication. Students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons arrive at the end of October, at which time eligible competitors place their name in the Goblet of Fire, hoping to be selected their school's champion in a magical ceremony. While the three names chosen are strong students, the Goblet offers some suspense when Harry’s name is chosen as a fourth competitor, even though he is not of age. However, one cannot defy the Goblet of Fire and so he is permitted to compete. Who could have done this, and for what reason?Ron is convinced Harry seeks praise and glory, sure that he’s tossed his name into the mix. This leads the best friends to stop speaking, putting Hermione in an awkward position as she tries to focus her attention on her school work and a new social movement involving House Trolls. Never one to shy away from controversy, Hermione pushes for their betterment, going against the grain of what much of wizardry has long accepted.The Triwizard tournament’s first task requires champions to fight dragons, something that Harry discovers he can do with some ease. It would seem his Quidditch skills prove helpful in his success. The danger factor seems high enough that Ron realises that Harry would not have put himself in harm’s way voluntarily. The boys are now convinced someone added the name to the Goblet to harm Harry. Between competitions, the school year progresses and Harry finds himself in the middle of numerous headaches. A silver tongued (and quilled) journalist, Rita Skeeter, publishes gossipy articles about Harry and others that have many ramifications and cause a great deal of emotional pain to those who are outed. Harry can only hope that things will settle, though it would seem no one is off limits when it comes to smearing them and being fodder for whispered conversations.The second task of the tournament is more daunting than the first. It involves collecting something from a lake filled with mer-people. Harry’s choice to be helpful almost costs him everything, though the judges see through his tardiness and award him high marks for his bravery. It would seem that Harry is well suited for the Triwizard Tournament, though there are still grumbles from other schools about his being an illegal competitor. Sirius Black returns in secret to help protect his godson. This elates Harry, but only adds more pressure and concern, as Hogwarts could soon be the location of a deadly strike. It completely clear now that there is someone who wants Harry dead, but no one can yet identify the culprit.It’s all down to the final task of the tournament, the most difficult of all the challenges. Harry is ready, but cannot have guessed who or what awaits him. A death shocks everyone who watches the tournament and Voldemort makes an appearance, hoping to regain much of the power he lost those years ago. Harry is vulnerable and this could mean the end to his time at Hogwarts, or worse... Mobilisation to combat the evil wizardry may be the only solution!J.K. Rowling has done it again, offering her readers a highly entertaining story that is sure to keep readers of all ages talking long after they finish the book. The story is full of nuances that will appeal to different reading levels, making the story ‘pop’ no matter how much the reader understands of her hidden meanings.Harry Potter reclaims the undisputed protagonist role in this story, maturing alongside his friends and fellow wizards as he tries to succeed during his fourth year of studies. While there is little backstory to offer, Harry’s past does become a part of his present and future, as Rowling addresses the scar and its symbolism a little more. The reader also gets to see a personal side of Harry, as romantic interests begin to play into his daily thoughts, while school is sometimes secondary or tertiary in importance. Perhaps teenage Harry will begin to emerge and offer a new flavouring for the upcoming novels, depending on how he is able to handle the struggles that Voldemort brings to the table. Rowling continues to offer strong supporting characters for readers, from the key individuals who have been present throughout the series, to new or minor characters claiming some of the spotlight. The constant evolution of the story permits Rowling to expand the wizard world and keep her readers from getting bored. As someone told me when they heard I was beginning this book, “you’ll soon see that Hogwarts is only the tip of the wizarding iceberg”. How true that has come to be.This was the first of the ‘truly complex novels’ in the series, books that exceed what I would expect Neo might want to handle. However, he devoured them with relative ease (thank goodness for audiobooks) and I can see Rowling needed every page to hash out some of the complex stories that bind this piece together. I am eager to see how things will keep progressing, as things are definitely getting more intricate and darker, which is sure to make for exciting reading. The book relies on a strong narrative to push it along and peppers curiously interesting characters to leave the reader wanting to know more. Much is revealed in things as simple as dialogue exchanges, but it requires attention and dedication. I can only surmise that some of the breadcrumbs will be important as the series progresses, so I am trying to stay on top of all aspects of the piece, even if they seem trivial. Longer chapters prove necessary to jam-pack all the story without losing the theme that each presents to the eager reader. There are only a few moments when I was left scratching my head, minute details that readers who binge-read the series will likely notice over those who space out the book experience. I’ll see if it continues.Kudos, Madam Rowling, another winner. I cannot wait to see what you have planned next and I want to get to it ASAP.Love/hate the review?

But Harry’s name came out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion. He cleared all three levels but when he reached near the trophy Cedric was also there so they decided that both will take it together. However the trophy was a port-key which took them to Voldemort who had regained his body with the help of Wormtail but this time too Harry survived. Meanwhile Cedric died and Harry kept blaming himself for his death. Dumbledore informs the Ministry of Magic about Voldemort but they think he has gone mad, hence don’t believe him or Harry at all.Blog | YouTube  | Instagram | Facebook | LinkedIn

I adore it; I adore the sense of adventure that spills over every page, the expansion of Rowling's magical universe, and the subtle changes that mark the book's passage from children's fiction to more mature young adult.When I was younger I especially adored the book because it introduced me to other magic societies and international schools of wizardry. While Rowling certainly doesn't mention a magic school anywhere near me, she opens up for the possibility. She expands her universe of wonder; she pushes the boundaries, and somehow everything seem closer. More relatable. Magic stops being a distinctly British thing and becomes an international phenomen. Something that could perhaps happen to a girl in Denmark as well. At least that's what I thought then. Rowling's novels are good, but they can at times feel very constricted. There are very few actual environments described; you have the village of Hogsmeade with all its colors and wonders (matching up to Diagon Alley), you have the muggle life with the Dursley family – always dreary, boring and painful, and you have Hogwarts of course, buzzing with energy, magic sparks and new adventures. At times you have a glimpse of London mixed with a visit at the Weasley's, an occasional tale from the dark prison of Azkaban, but that's really it.Until this book. Not only does it introduce new schools and new environments – it also takes us to graveyards of horror and Rowling finally mixes her two spheres (the muggle world and the wizarding worlds) in a glorious game of Quidditch. You get to see the union of these two, very different, worlds, and you finally understand how they aren't as separate as one would think; how they depend on each other, gravitate towards each other, and hide each other. Constantly.It's beautiful. And well worth the wait.

Two other rival schools of magic will take part as Harry is forced to take part following the mysterious introduction of his name into the Goblet of Fire...Oh Hagrid, you sweet cinnamon roll. He has a bit of a tough time in this one (when does he not, to be honest), but still manages to retain his dignity and come out stronger on the other side. I'm really feeling more appreciative of Hagrid on this re-read. I couldn't deal with how sad I felt when he was considering resigning from his post at Hogwarts following all the scandal after the Daily Prophet article. He got all sad and upset, and when Hagrid is upset, you bet your ass I am upset!!Anyway, I went on a bit of a Hagrid detour there... back to the book itself. I thought my big reread of 2018 would help me finally decide upon which Harry Potter book is my favourite. Four books in and I'm already feeling conflicted between Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire! I don't think I'll ever have a definitive answer to that question - and that ain't a bad thing.One of my favourite things about Goblet of Fire is getting to learn more about the two other Wizarding schools. I am a sucker for learning and knowledge. And the whole Triwizard Tournament in general is just so much fun! Harry's preparation and studying before teach of the tasks remind me of being in school, and given that I was one of those strange beings who enjoyed school, this is a very pleasurable reading experience.Goblet of Fire also has Molly Weasley being extra maternal towards Harry and these scenes always pull at my heart strings. The world needs more Molly Weasley's - she just reminds me of my own mum (how lucky am I!). And then we also have all the DRAMA of the Yule Ball! In particular, Harry and Ron being rude AF - their poor dates!! This one also hurts my heart in terms of the big fall out between Harry and Ron, it just doesn't feel right when those two aren't talking. It makes me sad. Trust Hermione to be the one to bang their heads together and sort shit out.My only minor nitpick with this one is the Quidditch World Cup. I'm sorry, but I just could not care any less. Any time Quidditch comes up I'm just skimming through, skipping ahead to more important things. Sports scenes like this are much more exciting to watch than read. Don't care!Harry Potter really brings out every emotion possible - from laughing your head off, to smiling broadly like an idiot at really poignant parts, to crying over THAT death, to getting so fucking angry at stupid Rita Shreever!! These books have it all - they're an emotional rollercoaster. But this is when the books start to get really dark - it's a tough ride from here, folks...5 stars.

It’s interesting to read foreign students’ accents. I like Professor Moody’s role in this book mainly because Malfoy and Snape are afraid of him. His crazy eye is cool, both to read and to watch in the movie. I enjoy reading Moaning Myrtle’s parts too and her role in the movie was well done. I like Hermoine and her passion to learn more knowledge, protect the elves, and stand by her friends no matter what. I watched the movie again before I finished reading this book and I like the book is better. I love the ending!This book is told in the third person point of view, following Harry Potter as he spends summer vacation at his aunt Petunia’s home. This summer, his cousin Dudley starts his diet, breakfast on grapefruit instead of bacon and cakes. Harry receives invitation to visit Ron’s home to attend the Quiddich’s World Cup. This book started out with Voldemort planning his comeback with the help of a backstabbing friend reader learned from book 3. In this fourth book of the series, readers will excite over Harry’s new adventures with him among the champions to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. The Defense Against the Dark Arts’ class is yet again having a new teacher this year. The school brings in a professional Dark Wizard Hunter called Auror named Mad-Eye. This book is thicker and longer than the previous 3 books and so much more mysteries and suspense.Another well written and excellent read, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire started out much darker than the previous books. I love reading about the riddle house and I wonder if it has a connection to the riddle we read about in the chamber of secrets. I love this book for the author’s ability to make my pulse race on some parts and my smile to laugh out loud on other parts. I like learning about how ambitions at work can ruin a family in the case of Barty Crouch. I like Professor Dumbledore. He’s a total package: calm, giving people second chances, and even though he knows students are breaking the rules, he still gives them the opportunity to explore and to make mistakes. It’s cute to see the characters are growing up and being shy at the hint of liking someone. I’m loving my re-read of this book and I highly recommend everyone to re-read the series!Pro: actions & adventures, friendships, mystery, suspense, humor, magical world, couldn’t put down, fast paced, page turner, easy to read, illustrationsxoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details

If the ""shit got real"" in the last book, well, in this fourth book shit got unreal.Goblet of Fire took the series forward and yet in tone it felt like a regression to the first two books. Certainly it is darker and slightly more mature in subject matter than the first two. However, there's a lingering ""freshman"" feel which I blame on the inclusion of the Tri Wizard Tournament. It seemed out of place at this point in the story. I have no problem with the idea that the wizarding establishment didn't believe (or want to believe) that Voldemort was back and ergo they would naturally carry on with their lives, as would the students, so the big sporting event is not precisely my issue. It's the amount of time spent on the event I'm taking to task. As readers, we know the ultimate evil has come again, so it's hard to suspend our dread and enjoy the fun and games of the tournament, or at least it was hard for me. Others I've spoke to don't seem to mind the ""fun and games"" aspect of this book. Yes, the Tri-Wizard Tournament is a useful tool in the fight versus evil, but it still seemed to me like Rowling hadn't given the storyline maturation its due. The mishandling of story pacing is perhaps more of a gripe. It's just as important as plot, realistic characters and appropriate dialogue. The story drags at times. Scenes that could have been truncated get a long airing. Sometimes it's necessary, sometimes it's not and it still works, and sometimes you feel like Rowling just couldn't help herself. Rating: 3.5 - Goblet... gets perhaps a higher rating from me than you'd think after reading that complainypants review, but the fact is the book is still entertaining, and at this point I was so very wrapped up in the series that Rowling could've taken a dump, published it and I would've given it at least two stars.

Things get a little darker here, the story has more layers, the plot is more complex, the villains more sinister, and length of the books much longer. The first three books are pretty formulaic, right? Harry is home with his awful aunt and uncle, he has to find some creative way to get to Hogwarts, he gets there, they eat and get sorted, it’s Halloween, it’s Christmas, there’s a chapter or two about a quidditch match, they have to solve some kind of problem, there’s a new teacher, Harry saves the day, five million points to Gryffindor, you know what I mean. This one breaks the mold. In fact, Hogwarts comes several chapters later. The story kicks off in a different setting, there is a huge tournament that throws a wrench into the typical plot outline, a lot of new characters are introduced, a lot of old friends return even if just for a moment, Hagrid’s got some new species he can’t handle...The complexity of the story really shines here, too. There are things from previous books that are suddenly important, there are characters with well-developed and integral backstories to dig into, some really crazy stuff went down a long time ago and impacts present events, and Voldemort isn’t messing around this time. He devised a pretty spectacular plan to get Harry, and... well... does it work?Of course it doesn’t work! There are still three more books and four more movies to go! Come on guys!

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter #6), J.K. Rowling Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during protagonist Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury, and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries.Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, with his Death Eaters kidnapping wand-maker Garrick Ollivander from Diagon Alley and destroying the Millennium Bridge. The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasley's new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is spotted and petrified by Malfoy. عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هری پاتر و پرنس نیمه اصیل»؛ «هری پاتر و شاهزاده دورگه»؛ «هری پاتر و پرنس دو رگه»؛ «هری پاتر و شاهزاده نیمه اصیل»؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه نوامبر سال 2005میلادیعنوان: هری پاتر و پرنس نیمه اصیل - کتاب شش در دو جلد؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: سمیه گنجی؛ ساری، زهره، 1384؛ در دوجلد، در660ص؛ شابک 9645704766؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 21معنوان: هری پاتر و شاهزاده ی دورگه - کتاب شش در دو جلد ؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: ویدا اسلامیه؛ تهران، تندیس، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک 9648944024؛ چاپ دوم تا هشتم 1384؛ چاپ یازدهم 1392؛ شابک 9789648944013؛عنوان: هری پاتر و پرنس دورگه - کتاب شش؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: غلامحسین اعرابی؛ تهران، پلیکان، 1384؛ در 912ص؛ شابک9648690065؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ ی دو‌رگه؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: محمدحسن واحد؛ قم گنج عرفان‏‫، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک9647985498؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ ی دو‌رگه؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: مریم شعبانی (نصیری آذر)؛ تهران، طحان، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ چاپ دیگر تهران علمی شایان‏‫، 1391؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک 9786009304219؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ ی نیمه اصیل؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: سعید ابراهیمی؛ تهران، نگاه امروز‏‫، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9647470002؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ نیمه اصیل؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: محمد نوراللهی؛ تهران، بهنام‏‫، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9645668360؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ دورگه؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: نامور عابدینی؛ تهران، نامور عابدینی‏‫، 1384؛ در سه جلد؛ شابک دوره9640670464؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ دورگه؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: الهام آرام نیا؛ شمس الدین حسینی؛ تهران، پیکان‏‫، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک دوره9643284913؛عنوان: هری‌ پاتر و شاهزاده‌ دورگه؛ نویسنده: جی.کی رولینگ؛ مترجم: شهناز مجیدی؛ تهران، روشا‏‫، 1384؛ در دو جلد؛فهرست: آن وزیر دیگر؛ بن‌بست اسپینر؛ وصیت‌نامه و جن خانه؛ هوریس اسلاگهورن؛ خلط اضافی؛ مسیر بیراهه‌ی دراکو؛ انجمن اسلاگ؛ اسنیپ پیروز؛ شاهزاده‌ی دورگه؛ خانه‌ی گونت؛ همکاری هرمیون؛ نقره و عقیق سلیمانی؛ ریدل، معمای مرموز؛ فلیکس فلیسیس؛ و پیمان ناگسستنی؛ششمين سال تحصيلی هری در مدرسه‌ ی علوم و فنون جادوگری هاگوارتز آغاز میشود؛ «آلبوس دامبلدور»، مدیر مدرسه، برای «هری» کلاس‌های خصوصی ترتیب میدهد، و در کلاس‌ها، او را با گذشته‌ ی «لرد ولدمورت»، و اندیشه ها و آرزوهای او آشنا میکند؛ و راز جاودانگی او را برملا میسازدنقل از متن جلد نخست: (هری پاتر با صدای بلندی خروپف می‌کرد؛ بیش‌تر چهار ساعت گذشته را در کنار پنجره‌ ی اتاق‌ خوابش، بر روی صندلی نشسته و به منظره‌ ی خیابان زل زده بود، که دم‌ به‌ دم تاریک‌تر می‌شد و سرانجام، در حالی که یک‌طرف صورتش به پنجره تکیه داشت، با دهان باز و عینک، یک وری، به خواب رفته بود؛ بخشی از شیشه‌ ی پنجره که در اثر نفس‌های او بخار گرفته بود، در برابر نور نارنجی رنگ چراغ خیابان می‌درخشید و در پرتو این نور غیرطبیعی، هیچ رنگ دیگری بر چهره‌ اش سایه نمی‌انداخت، چنان که صورتش در زیر سیاهی متضاد موهای نامرتبش، رنگ پریده و ترسناک به نظر می‌رسید؛ اتاق، پر از وسایل درهم ریخته‌ ی گوناگون و خرده آشغال‌های پراکنده بود؛ پرهای جغد، دانه‌های سیب و کاغذهای مچاله‌ ی شکلات در گوشه و کنار اتاق ريخته بود؛ چندین کتاب جادوگری لابه‌لای رداهای درهم گوریده‌ ی روی تختش قرار داشت و دسته‌ ی نامرتب روزنامه‌ها بر روی میز تحریرش در زیر هاله‌ ای از نور به چشم می‌خورد؛ عنوان یکی از روزنامه‌ها گویی با داد و فریاد، خودنمایی می‌کرد: هری پاتر: پسر برگزیده؟)؛ پایانتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 09/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 30/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

I was first introduced to Harry Potter in a Children’s Lit class in college. I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn’t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I’ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn’t have been willing to admit in college that I’m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she’s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it’s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain’s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don’t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort’s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (“muggle” in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother’s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the “muggle” blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents’ death.With Dumbledore’s help in exploring Voldemort’s past, Harry begins to understand that he’s come to be where he is through the choices he’s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that’s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort’s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?

Here's the thing about the Harry Potter books...They're awesome.Deep, huh? Well, deep or shallow, it's the truth. I waited a long time to read the Harry Potter books because I wanted to experience them with my own children. My son (8) and I just finished the sixth book, my first daughter (6) and I are working on the first, and my youngest child (3) is content to commandeer her siblings' wands and run around shrieking, ""I have a Harry Potter stick!""In other words, we all enjoy it.I could write a great deal about Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but it's a tough book to write about without giving things away. And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite characters, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, ""Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin."" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:""Yes, you have,"" said Dumbledore firmly. ""You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---""""I know!"" said Harry impatiently. ""I can love!"" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, ""Big deal!""""Yes, Harry, you can love,"" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. ""Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.""""So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?"" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.""Yes---just love,"" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you.

I'm really enjoying this series so far but this series gets darker and darker. the first three of this series were so funny and cute even though there were sad scenes on them and the fourth, fifth and sixth books contained so much pain and I even shed more tears for these book than I did for the the first three. I have lost a favorite character that always made me laugh and smile. this character is Sirus Black. I even still can't get over his death. but let's admit it that maybe there's a death of character that we will never get over.*takes deep breath* okay let's talk about this book ・。・゜★・。・。☆・゜・。・゜。・。・゜★・。・。☆・。・゜★・。・。
PHLEGM
 I have never liked Fleur Delacour very much since I first saw her on the book four and then I saw her again on the book four as Bill's girlfriend or Fiancee and I also laughed when Ginny called Fleur Phlegm. I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD 
Ron and Hermione
I ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.And I was so angry in that moment 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did. 
Harry And Ginny
have you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book  'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ... 
Dumbledore's death
I admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys!

4.5 Golden Stars92%yeah, it was dark, but probably the most Hilarious book of HP; it IS a Comedy! I was rolling in laughter! by Hilarious Ron, sassy Harry & Hermione's wittiness & the unique fun in the writing style, the impression, the descriptions, the comparisons.anyway, don't get mad at me, but this book is my least favourite in Harry Potter series. it was kind of disappointment for me.3 years gap, reading the other fantastic books many times, guessing & after that shocking end in book 5, looking forward to this one, to be greater than others as we are close to end...in one sentence: I was not satisfied after reading it. (IK the book was the calm before the storm, but still.)& don't get me wrong; it was a disappointment Only compared to other HP books.Boring start. (2 chapters without anything related to Hogwarts or the golden trio)Harry was obsessed with what Malfoy was up to, the whole year & for the first time, I found Harry annoying many times. maybe this is the main reason I didn't like this book. (I hate 'Sectumsempra' chapter , always get mad at him.)yelling many times:Don't!No!you idiot, Harry!because he is my favourite character...💔(though now after many times re-reading, I actually found funny parts too, thankfully)at the end, he was right though.also, lack of funny sarcastic verbal fights between Harry & Draco :(almost whole events were like side-jobs; like the Slug club.truth: I don't care about Slughorn either. those chapter he just talked & talked about celebrities once-were-his students... ughhhh. Adrenaline peak parts were not satisfying & not enough (amounts). the whole story was a bit ordinary & nothing happened in the whole school year, in particular. (like school wasn't at an immediate, solid grave danger (book 2, 3, 7 & maybe 5), the golden trio wasn't on solving mysteries (1, 2, 4, 5, 7) or something as intriguing as these. they were just attending classes, boring parties, slug club & these normal stuff.but in total, other parts (except Malfoy & Slug club); maybe not high peak of adrenaline (as I said), but interesting, we all wanted to know who the half-blood prince was, Quidditch was funny & the parts with Dumbledore was fascinating.I liked the second half of the book more, like finally this book stepped into action!But main reason: his obsession with Malfoy; 'OMG! Harry, just come off it!', therefore Harry being annoying, therefore lack of Harry's sarcasm comebacks with Malfoy, lowered this book to my least favourite.BUT....on the bright side, there are parts I love too:❤ sassy Harry was the best!There's no need to call me ""sir"", professor. Bless you JKR!Bless you Harry Potter!one of the sassiest comments in the history of sass masters!my first reaction when I see this, was: ""omg! Harry! did you just...!?"" & then re-read the sentence to see if I got it right & then... putting the book down (""Hail Harry Potter!"") & burst out laughing!""Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow..."" (Gee! Thanks Ron!)""I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough!”although there was no sarcastic comebacks between Harry & Malfoy, but this book had many funny moments by other characters.Harry was not just being sassy & sarcastic, but also being funny & clueless too, which was laughable.Ron's jokes with ghosts always made me choke with laughter!""and I'll take his secret to the —""  ""— not the grave, surely?"" said Ron with a snort. ""The sewers, maybe.""LOL a lot!❤ FriendshipsHarry & Ron's friendship (always one of my favourite brotps) funny, great, looking after each other. always love it, in all books.""Nice,"" he said. ""Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.""  ""If you tell them,"" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, ""I — I — I’ll —""  ""Stutter at me?"" said Harry, grinning. ""Come on, would I!?""Roonil Wazlib!also Harry & Hermione's. (especially after Ron & Hermione's bickering), beautiful, caring, protective. again, I love it in all the books.“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,” said Hermione angrily.“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever?” said Harry, stung by this.I actually noticed after years of rereading, now Romione has lowered in its place for me & I ship these two much more. they care so much for each other.(I'm thinking it's also a brotp for me too. well, it's complicated to decide if I want to accept the canon (because I do love canon too) or my mind. the point is, I love the moments with these two together :)❤ the writing style is just Unique & perfect & funny!❤ my favourite chapters are ""the Cave"" & ""Horcruxes""; awesome, exciting with unexpected amount of surprises. I actually loved them.I loved the main-stream parts with Dumbledore.I loved how Harry, at some points, admired Tom.& how he unfolded this story & also sympathized with other characters.❤ at least after that terrible mistake (mentioned above), the chapter ended beautifully; my favourite part, that magical romantic moment, how well described, what a glamorous scene. My first ship finally sinking! ""Harry looked around; there was (view spoiler)[Ginny (hide spoiler)] running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments, or it might have been half an hour-or possibly several sunlit days- they broke apart.The creature in his chest roaring in triumph.""(& I was really angry when the movie CHANGED this scene! actually I really loved the first 3 movies (they were so similar to the books) & 5 too (tho it was a bit different & they mostly deleted the humor parts), 4 was similar enough, just darker than my imagination. but movies 6 & 7 just had the same quotes (almost) & changed or deleted scenes a lot, therefore those completely disappointed me. :(❤ & I was proud Harry became (view spoiler)[Team Captain (hide spoiler)]!Quidditch were funny, especially the first one (You Clever Harry! XD). except not the commentator, but Harry made a funny moment of that too ;)❤ Don't forget how Gracefully this book was written. (& how delicate she chose to show they were swearing without any direct swears, I love it, it doesn't make me apprehensive, on the contrary, it makes me laugh very hard & respect the pure talent.)Hail Queen!10th read; November 2019: I could've given 5 Stars because of Sassy Harry (I mean, Harry just being savagely Sassy this year! XD) & beautiful, magnificent choices of the words & compare to a few of my 5 stars this book definitely deserves 5; but I'm not satisfied with it (still things that annoy me) so I probably won't. Although there's a progress, the rating score has risen to 4.5 now.-World building: ★★★★★/5Characters: ★★★★★/5/ Characters development: ★★★★(★)/5Written style: ★★★★★/5Plot: ★★★/5General idea: ★★★★(★)/5

Reminder that all of my Harry Potter reviews contain unmarked spoilers, and lots of ’em. If you’re one of the two people on Goodreads who hasn’t read this series, this review is not for you. So, my dear underside-of-a-rock-residing friends:https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...This review will be interesting, because this book was far (far, far) from perfect, and yet I am utterly determined to give it 5 stars. (Which I have only given to the first book in this series.)God, how do you talk about this book? It’s really amazing. It is really hard for me to feel anything while reading a book or generally living my life. For example, I felt nothing when Sirius died. Nothing throughout most of this series, actually. And nothing in this book, because nothing happened and everyone survived and everything is sunshiney and joyful!Ugh. I tried. The last hundred-ish pages of this book really tore me apart. Okay, even that’s not true. I’ll just come out and say it: I’m really f*cking sad that Dumbledore died. I love him so much. He’s high up in my top 5 characters. (Do I even have a top 5?) I’m devastated, which makes me even more upset, because I have a life to live today and can’t just lay around and wallow in fictional pain.I’m going to move on in the hopes that I just. Forget. Because I don’t like this at ALL.Here, we see Harry Potter - who, I think few will argue, has been a fairly mediocre character up to this point - become AMAZING. He’s motivated solely by his need to work against injustice and evil. He realizes his parents’ legacy within himself. He denounces the sucking up of others. He works hard in school! He is a good friend even when his two BFFS are being childish to one another plus refusing to believe him. In short, he’s really, really, five-star-level great here. Gorgeous character development in 650 pages.I didn’t think I liked Ginny much, because I didn’t remember this book well...like, at all. But she is so great! So funny. I wish there was more of her in this book.Also, I’ll fight anyone who says Dumbledore is ~the real villain~ of this series. He’s really not. (Cough, Snape is, cough.) AND YOU'RE NOT EDGY, PEOPLE WHO HATE DUMBLEDORE BUT LOVE SNAPE. YOU'RE JUST DUMB. I fell deeply in love with the guy. (Dumbledore, not Snape. BLEH.) AND I F*CKING MISS HIM. Goddamn it. Trying to forget didn’t last very long. Anyway.I missed Hermione and Neville. Hermione was absolutely not well-represented here at all. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s not a Ravenclaw (#RavenclawPride) because she works fully against logic throughout this book. And when she’s not she just, like, refuses to believe Harry.Ron is soooooooooo annoying! Is he anyone’s favorite character? He’s like, Fred or George if one of them was totally childish and attention-starved and mean. In fact, Ronald is a pretty impressive character for the number of gross character traits he embodies despite being supposed to be a good character. Mean, immature, rude, jealous, definition of an inferiority complex. Bleh.Harry and Ginny I’m totally for, BUT THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS BOOK ARE SO BORING. Can we do Hermione and Fred instead? Ron and Luna would be cute. Or, God forbid, some LGBT representation? WE KNOW YOU’RE A SUPPORTER, JOANNE. Don’t even get me started on Lupin and Tonks.Speaking of supposedly-good characters’ downfalls: I’m no longer a Hagrid fan. It started with the last book and came fully around here. Like, at a certain point, the man needs a character trait. Liking weird animals, making bad food, and being humongous don’t count. Harry and Hermione’s constant stubbornness is annoying. Plus makes the plot repetitive once in a while. Also, Tonks. You know what, I guess I AM going to get started on Lupin and Tonks! She was a hilarious badass in the last book, totally depressed and weak in this one. I know I sound like a total emotionless asshole here, but that’s who I am, and she’s annoying in this book. AND IT’S TOTALLY FINE BECAUSE SHE’S JUST BEING A SPINELESS IDIOT OVER SOME DUMB SHABBY MAN. Kill me, please. Then I can see my beloved Dumbledore again.Too much Snape. (Cannot WAIT to write the rant on him.) Too much Draco. (Why do people romanticize that little weirdo so much? I guess I get the temptation, but he’s a bully at best and a spineless traitor at worst.) I hate Kreacher and I hate Dobby...I hated Winky, too...I might hate house elves. If that makes me racist against a species of fictional character, SO BE IT, I GUESS.I miss Fred and George, and the fun people from the Order (if they existed), and Hermione and Neville aren’t here nearly enough. The price of Harry’s amazing and concise character development is WAY too many bad characters, not nearly enough of the good ones. EXCEPT DUMBLEDORE. UGHHHH. I’M SO SAD. (I think my inability to cry is making this worse. Maybe if I just creepily sobbed in front of my roommate for a few minutes I’d feel better. Damn you, my lack of emotions! Just kidding love you.)But I want to give this book five stars more than anything. It was so compulsively readable, more than any other book since the first for me. And it’s the last book where our pals are attending Hogwarts. That makes me so sad. It’s such a gorgeous setting and I’m going to miss it so much. WHY IS THIS BOOK SO SAD?! If Deathly Hallows is any sadder I’ll be seriously impressed. And also seriously screwed.And, okay, even though I was a harsh critic of these books...I’m really going to miss this series. I’ve been rereading it on and off (obviously) for three months, and it’s been a fun ride. This is one of the greatest settings of all time. And since I’m rereading it after 10 years, it’s like saying goodbye twice. AND I HATE ENDINGS.Bottom line: Okay, THIS is my favorite Harry Potter book. (Anyone else’s?) Unreal character development + tragic and lovely adieu to a gorgeous setting + ability to make me feel real, deep emotion + compulsively readable? An absolute dream.----------ORIGINAL REVIEW---------------Ron and Hermione's will-they-won't-they is a total snoozefest. I propose Fred & Hermione and Ron & Luna instead. Also seven more books!

Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix putting up a fight against the Dark Eaters.4. . Harry breaking up with Ginny which reminds me of Peter Parker and Mj. Finally, as a simple tribute to the wisest, kindest, most revered and one of the most powerful wizards (whose death out of the many deaths hurts me the most that I cried so much, I may have cried harder than Hagrid), the following is a collection of a few of his great thoughts and words that’ll be forever etched in our hearts. *sniffs*  “In fact, being-forgive me- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”  “People find it a lot easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.”  “It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.”   “Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.""   “The pain is part of being human. The fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.”   “To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.”   “It’s not really goodbye after all.” On a lighter note, it's beautiful Katerina's birthday today, let's spare a few moments to greet her a HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY! Even though you're quite busy for Goodreads and reading atm, I hope you're doing something that's making you happy today! Enjoy! <3

Spoilers for anyone who has never read the books or seen the movies. In which case, have you been living under a rock?!(view spoiler)[""Do not pity the dead, Harry.

I like the way his first-day-of-the-year speeches make no sense at all. I like how he uses different types of candy for his office passwords. I like how he says he sees a new pair of socks in the Mirror of Erised. I like how he believes Harry unconditionally, no matter how farfetched his story may seem. He’s been a guide, a counselor, a friend, not only to Harry, but to everyone Albus cared about. He’s been a shoulder, a rock, some form of hope to everyone who had the privilege to be a part of his life. Everyone looked up to him. The darkest wizard of all time feared him. Yet he never looks dangerous. He is always this calm, serene person with a smile on his face, entertaining us with his wise, often odd sayings. He never put himself first; always thought of others. And even after his death will he be a beacon of hope, of faith, of everything the good side represents.Professor Dumbledore, I will always be loyal to you. You will never be forgotten.May you rest in peace.Even though he was a bit of a dick sometimes. (hide spoiler)]

Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts. With Lord Voldemort on the loose things are going very bad in wizard community; all the troubles spill in the Muggle world. Unsurprisingly the book begins with a chapter with real Muggle Prime Minister - somewhat unnecessary I might add. If you think you can find anything original in this review you are sadly mistaken. It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry. Another complaint is fairly big and I will use spoiler tags for it. The underground lake scene: (view spoiler)[this came out really stupid for me. You had to drink the liquid to get the locket? You could not just reach it with you hand, fine. You could scoop the water with a goblet? Why not pour it out instead of drinking?  (hide spoiler)]Yet another big one: Snape (view spoiler)[Now that I know what is going on reading the second chapter I quite agree with Harry: he is probably the bravest man of the series. (hide spoiler)]The tragedy at the end still feels like a read tragedy during the reread while the impact of what happened at the end of the previous book considerably lessened when I read it the second time. So all the nitpicks aside I still rate this book with a perfect rating; it is well worth it. P.S. I always wanted to say it in one of the reviews for a book of the series; this feels like a good place: when it comes to movies, Richard Harris beats the crap out of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I am not questioning the acting abilities of the latter, but the former suited to the role much better. I leave you with the following:

“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.”
I really enjoyed many parts of this book, yet the last few chapters tore my heart out and crushed it into the ground. The development of these characters is surprisingly good too. It seems everyone has their way to deal with the problems. Harry and Hermione are perfect together, but not in the romantic way. The climax blew my mind and I didn't want to do anything more than sobbing quitely on the pillow. J.K. Rowling did a good job when she started writing this book, she knew how to unify the pieces scattering around these six books.
“Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!”

I cannot remember enjoying this book as much as I did now. I actually thought this was one of my least favorite in the series but now I’ve realized that it’s actually one of my favorites. I liked this book much more than the fifth and read it much faster. I have no idea why but I found many parts in this book funny. I laughed a lot more than usual when I read Harry Potter books. This book was perfect and amazing in every way possible. My second favorite character in the series is Draco and in this book, I felt so bad for him. He probably wouldn’t have gone off to the dark side if his dad wasn't there first. It was obvious that he and his mother didn’t want to follow Voldemort. When he hesitated to kill Dumbledore and was considering taking his offer of leaving the dark side I felt so bad for him. Also in the bathroom when he was crying really made me feel sorry for him because I don’t think he would be all rude and mean if it wasn’t for his parents and the way he was brought up. Harry and Ginny. To me, they should have never been a thing. I have always hated Ginny and the fact that Harry starts to like her annoys me so much. I hated her from the beginning and I have no idea why. I always wanted Harry with Hermione and not with Ron but my ships always crash. But then again Hermione is way too smart for Harry and Ron. Harry being with Ginny slightly rubbed off on me after re-reading this book, but keyword being slightly. Although, I still don’t like Ginny and I don’t think I ever will. I always disliked her since the beginning and I also don't think I will be completely okay with them together. This book proves that Harry Potter is an idiot and there was a reason he was never put in Ravenclaw. I mentioned this in my review of the first book but one day my friend and I were talking about HP and she told about how Harry is so dumb. First of all, Snape has been teaching him for 5 years. 5 YEARS yet Harry wasn’t able to recognize his handwriting. I cannot understand how Harry could not pick it up. I mean Snape had been his teacher for 5 years and was writing in front of them yet Harry couldn't put two and two together. Hermione probably could have figured it out but she never read the book. Does he not pay attention at all? I mean you’d have to never listen or read anything in class to not pick it up.After he finds this book, which has spells written around it, he thinks it's perfectly fine to start using them. This book obviously belonged to someone who was a dark wizard but yet he sees these spells and thinks ‘oh nothing bad should happen I mean this book only was written by someone who was interested in the darks arts’. Then he decides to test a spell on Draco and he doesn’t even know what the spell does. I get Draco was trying to torture him with the Cruciatus Curse but there are still other spells he could have used to stop him. Then he tries to convince Snape that his nickname is Roonil Wazlib. Obviously, Snape won't fall for that. Don’t get me wrong I love this series and I do like Harry but he is so stupid.I enjoyed this book a lot and found it really funny. I feel like reading this book made me love the series more and I’m not sure if that was even possible. I wish after finishing the series I can erase my mind and re-read the series. I am so excited to carry on even though I know what happens next. I want to wait for a little before carrying on to the last book because I don't want to finish re-reading the series. I don’t want it to end becuase I’m so obsessed with this series!!!

Harry wants to fight as well, but as he is still a student he is limited in what he can do.

A rumour has been circulating through the masses. That Harry will be the one to kill Voldemort in the end. Well, the rumours aren't wrong. 
Neither can live while the other survives
This story is much slower paced than the others but I still enjoyed every moment. Even though they are in danger now that Voldemort and Co. are killing openly — we get to see normal life at Hogwarts for Harry. And honestly I could read another 600 page book about normal everyday Hogwarts life. The atmosphere of this book is very different from Order of the Phoenix. Harry is more at ease now that the wizarding community believes him. I mean yes, there were still some terrible things going on, but things are now sort of calm at Hogwarts. The humour in this book is so great. From Slughorn, Lavender Brown and Cormac Mclaggen — this book is seriously entertaining every time. 
“Let us step into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”
Harry's lessons with Dumbledore were from my favourite scenes. And I think that's what makes the last few chapters completely GUT WRENCHING. Fun fact: this book is the first one that ever made me cry. I vividly remember 13 year old me crying into my pillow at 2 AM. 😂 I will not deny that it still breaks my heart everytime I reread this book and it probably will everytime. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince shall forever have a most special place in my heart. ___We're doing this! Buddy read with Warda and He Who Must Not Be Named

I remember reading fan theories about him coming back to life because his patronus was a phoenix, and I wanted to believe them even though I knew he had to stay dead for Harry to really become the hero he needed to be.

“Parry Otter, the Chosen BoyWho — well — something of that sort.”



This reread of
  Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince -
the last book in my minimal book collection - came as a saving grace during the many (many)holidays of Tishri. The stillness that accompanies sitting with your own thoughts during the countless rest days is painstakingly growing on me, so I needed something to look forward to, other than the many family-talks speculating about what's ahead.I'm giving myself permission to sidetrack first into a bit of a backstory, given that this book did the same with itsrather long ""Previously on Harry Potter"" starting point,catching the reader up on the 411.Back in late 2014 -THE year I started reading Harry Potter for the first time and the same year I promised myself I'd finish the series - I made the hefty mistake of picking up the fifth book, 
  
    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
  
, from the library on its own right before Hanukkah, meaning that the sequel wouldn't be available for another week. I then dutifully devoured the fifth book by day two and convinced my mom that the only thing I wanted, nay needed, was the sequel, which I promptly completed in time to take the finale from the library.(Spoilers: I finished the series with two days to spare of 2014 in which I also finishedTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Beforeto provide me some of that lightheartedness, as I mention in my review.)I personally had a rocky start with reading the series. The first book took me multiple times to pick up and complete; it took me months of what I usually read within a week. I remember now really getting into the series with the fourth and fifth book, though I can't recall now which works better in my favor.

    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
  
is probably my favorite because I'm a sucker for dreams and nightmares being interpreted and taken seriously. The minute you start paying attention that's when you start seeing more clear signs that can easily give answers to your own personal situation.This sixth book seemed promising to me, as well, because ofthe Pensieve and its many memories we dive into. This is the only way to do flashbacks... especially given the unbiased perspective to these unfolding events, like getting an introduction into Voldemort's family line from someone employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement,and then slowly piecing together bits of information through the many reveals.But before all that can happen, the book starts off where Harry feels most at peace: The Burrow. I love me some good ol' family dynamics with the Weasleys (and being a united front againstPhlegmFleur).“Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.”Harry is slowly starting to view Ginny as a safe haven; she represents all good and safety in the world for Harry, which he desperately seeks with the upheaval that is his own life. I laughed when my mind associated Harry's choice of Ginny Weasley with that scene from Parks and Rec with the Saperstein twins:
Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince
  
centers on the more obsessed-like state of Harry with Malfoy, Hermione sulking away from Won-Won, Roonil Wazlib making a mighty comeback, the frustration when no one believes Harry's valid suspicions, and so much more which I featurebelow in my favorite points:• The sly insert when Slughorn dismisses Ron's name with:“...after what happened to your poor friend Rupert.” Clearly, filming for the Harry Potter series was well underway.• This particular book in the series feels like the inspiration behind Baz and Simon in Fangirl (and Carry On) what with the slow-moving plot till the characters arrive onto school grounds, and the aforementioned nemesis-watching from afar and following their every move.“Levi sat back, hugging the pillow again. “They are kind of gay, aren’t they? What with all the watching each other sleep… and the ignoring Penelope.”I'm personally not into the whole Draco/Harry ship, given Draco literally smashed Harry's face in just because (this ruthlessness is what's so vivid in my mind, so much so that the hurt of that scene traveled through back four years when I first read it and I felt the exact same shock) and also the simple fact that Draco Malfoy is a terribly cruel character. Those types need to stray far, far from humans until they acquire some anger management tools. He's basically a reincarnation of Snape (the only reason they get along) what with all the sulking and pettiness (Snape with Lily, and Draco with his need to acquire power). Just because you've marked a certain person/goal as ""MINE"" in your head doesn't make it so it's yours. So the author trying to make me feel sorry for either of them won't work in my favor. Like, ""Woe is me. All I want is the approval of the Dark Lord.""It's also the reason why I'm not rushing to reread the following book given the frustrations whenever an author dismisses the actions of an evil character, like Snape, for ""Oh, Love..."" You've painted your picture for the whole series, making us not only hate but despise Severus Snape, so you can't just drop this pent-up anger with one scene in the seventh book. Snape ""loving"" (more like, marking his territory) a certain someone who chooses not to settle for him doesn't justify his following actions, no matter what storyline tries to redeem him.• The one thing that really settled with me was when Harry and Dumbledore were discussingdestiny and ""theprophecy"" and how it's neither here nor there: Voldemort sculpted his own enemy, by choosing to believe that prophecy he molded you into his enemy. I listened to a lecture on the topic that voiced a similar idea that in order for there to be good in the world there needs to be evil to defeat.“Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!’Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.‘I’d want him finished,’ said Harry quietly. ‘And I’d want to do it.’‘Of course you would!’ cried Dumbledore. ‘You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal … in other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you … which makes it certain, really, that -‘‘That one of us is going to end up killing the other,’ said Harry. ‘Yes.’”• The main plot-propelling point is circling around the Pensieve, which at the time of reading I found so fascinating and wondered what memories I would store away. However brilliant the first memory from Bob Ogden, sooner than later these flashbacks start feeling like a contrived set up for a grander plot-device, especially when Dumbledore speaks like he's looking through a crystal ball; Professor Trelawney seems tame in comparison.“Why?’ said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face. ‘Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?’‘I have ideas,’ said Dumbledore, ‘but no more than that.’‘What ideas, sir?’‘I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn,’ said Dumbledore. ‘When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear … to both of us.”This was so defeating to read the first time, being held on a leash with the information that could be released, but on this reread, knowing what's ahead, I could relax and take in all the suspense and foreshadowing.• It's unfortunate, though, that the author deems all these important adult figures in Harry's life valuable only long enough to serve him in the grand scheme of things. Children need adults to look up to for longer than a semester period. I noticed that even when I was having a good time reading, half-way through a thought would creep in to remind me that half of the characters wouldn’t survive this series… and then it felt somehow wrong to laugh at something they said.•Which leads me to discuss the one thing that I dreaded and put-off... I'd forgotten that rereading Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince meant reliving this emotional trauma of a chapter all-over again. I honestly can't believe I got fooled twice into believing that Snape would come to heal Dumbledore. I was utterly and positively assured that when Severus Snape came running down towards Dumbledore it was to cure him of his wounds. My brain somehow managed to repress the memory of that scene and fooled me into believing the same damn thing I thought the very first time... Evidently, the events of this series have all mixed into one for me so that certain scenes from the last book I expect to show up in here. Though nothing prepared me for this line that broke everything:
‘I am not worried, Harry,’ said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. ‘I am with you.’
If nothing else, I'll certainly miss his sage sayings:



      ‘Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,’ said Hermione.
    


I commend the cover illustrator, Jonny Duddle, for taking one of the most painful moments in the book and creating such lively artwork out of it:The illustration on the back cover, in particular, had me staring back and forth to take it all in: the tired eye-bags, the sullen face, the grip on his left arm. SO MUCH DETAIL.And on that chipper note, I'll conclude by saying that taking my time with this reread made the journey so worth it.

For a long time this book had a special place in my freezer with my favorite ice creams and frozen food I was banned to cook (I eventually burn them when I defreeze them. I was born with non-culinary skills!) I repeated what Joey Tribbianni did because after finishing this book I cried so hard, I cursed nonstop, I screamed till my local cords declare their uselessness and I tried to throw the hardcopy out of the window but I changed my mind because an innocent kid may have found the book at the outside and started to read and cry nonstop! So instead of throwing away or burning the pages( which is so harsh punishment because this book is still a classic and it’s one of the best ones of the series)freezing the book and never forgiving the author for killing one of my favorite characters were the best choices I’ve had.As my new weekend quarantine habit: I started retro weekend tradition and reread my favorite series. Even though this book broke my heart more than a decade before, at least this time I prepared myself with lots of tissues and golden toilet papers( they’re so precious things and I hang them on the walls with hand sanitizers as if they’re historical artifacts.) and I bottled up my happy memories inside my head to protect my heart tear apart.  This is sweet 16 adventures of Harry: the girl crushes, secret smiles, hormonal and characteristic changes, seeing the world from different aspect! If I didn’t get so sad with the unexpected ending, this might be second favorite HP book because JKR- wizard of the words reflected the emotional and psychical changing as they grow up more and realize the biggest danger out there to steal their best times of their lives.I never get bored to reread any HP books or anything JKR writes. (instead of shopping list. Lately they made me sleep!) So I had quite great time with my nostalgic journey to the past and realize I will find myself reading these books a decade later and I will still get the great taste of literature and have quality time. That’s the magic of skilled writing and gifted talent!

Book Review

4 out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the 6th book in the Young Adult Fantasy series written in 2005 by J.K. Rowling. Although I could go on and on about this book, there are so many other reviews and reviewers who are likely to have a better one simply because they wrote it write after reading the book or watching the movie. I read it close to ten years ago, saw the movie at least 5 years ago, and though I would love to re-read them... my TBR pile is way too high. That said... it's a fantastic series full of wild imagination, great beauty and intricate sentiment. In this book, Harry must connect with the past and his dark side, trying to figure out who this half-blood prince is... and when he finds out, everything is different. The book is about relationships... discovering things about yourself and others that you didn't know. And when someone Harry absolutely adores is murdered right in front of him, and it's connected with the half-blood prince, it sends Harry on a downward spiral, out of control, but necessary for him to find the inner strength to fight Lord Voldemort. I can't even begin to write a review for this book... let's just go get some coffee or a drink and talk about it. It requires us having an animated conversation... right?

I have the perfect example to use from this book: when Draco Malfoy tries to use one of the Unforgivable Curses on Harry, at Hogwarts no less, Harry's not the least bit interested to tell anyone, but when he turns a corner, we get to read a entire page about Peeves the Poltergeist throwing chalk at him. . . again. Yes, Harry, make sure and go tell staff that Peeves is throwing chalk at you, but leave off that boring business of the student trying to kill you in the bathroom. Such inconsistencies annoy me.Also, after rereading some 3,350 pages of Harry Potter so far this year, I can't help but wonder. . . how are we to keep suspending our disbelief that the adult wizarding world times their actions to coincide perfectly with the school year at Hogwarts? I mean, how can every evildoer in the wizarding world be inspired to perform their misdeeds right as the school year comes to a close in June? Couldn't she just one time have made some bad shit happen in February? This is a writing habit that has just been way too tidy for me.And yet. . . here I was. . . rereading book 6 aloud to my middle child in our living room as my son was in the background, moving his belongings back into the house for summer when I got to this part:“Sir, you haven't told us what's in this one,” said Ernie Macmillan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn's desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface, though not a particle had spilled.My son stop moving, set down the box that had been in his hands, then came and sat down on the couch and said, “Felix Felicis.” My daughter and I nodded our heads in approval and Hermione Granger contributed, “It's liquid luck.”Next thing you know, my littlest child poked her head around the corner and revealed that she'd been listening as well. My middle child blew up in anger at her, throwing a pair of dirty socks at her head, but her little sister prevailed and came into the center of the living room and declared as she sat down on the carpet, “I just want to listen to the story.”Imagine me now, feeling the bliss, reading my favorite Harry Potter book to all three of my kids at once, in the center of my living room, on a beautiful spring day. And that right there is the magic, folks. It's not that I'm the world's most engaging narrator. It's not that J.K. Rowling writes novels like Graham Greene. J.K. Rowling's magic is in her storytelling.Storytelling is not writing, and not all writers are storytellers, but good writing that contains excellent storytelling takes the reading experience to the sublime.We clambered to the climax of this story together and now we are poised to take on the last novel together, next week. When I asked my middle child how many stars out of five for this one, she answered: ONE THOUSAND.So, ONE THOUSAND stars out of five.

One of the things I adore about Harry Potter that it's set in the real world ,""Our World"" ..the beginning of that book implant that concept.. that the events we're reading since book one is happening here in our real world,The Prime Minister scene/chapter is real amazing addition to the series,and it include most of the major events we witnessed happened at the Wizardry world through the previous books and how it affect our world.The characters get more complicated here at that book..as for Snape secrets reveal...shocking for some and relieve those who always mistrust him being in the good side.. Well plotted twist from J K -which won't stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in Snape's character- Also there's a depth in Draco's character that really serve the plot of this and next book.Then the guardian role of Dumbledore at Harry's life start to manifest at that book. Then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world -like the Diagon ally scene was darker than ever. And there's also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age. You'll love the Hermione-Ron relation.In short ..... it's the best way to introduce the beginning of the end of a Saga .

You Should Be Worrying About U-NO-POO--the Constipation Sensation That's Gripping the Nation!""* Luna's Quidditch commentary. Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator.* The effects of Felix Felicis.* We get a fascinating view of the history of Tom Riddle.* The major question of the book: Whose side is Snape really on?Amazon Review:The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, ""Is it worth the hype?"" The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way.

Personally however, I may have enjoyed this one more. Mostly because there are few things I enjoy more than backstory. And while this series lacks a lot in many aspects, it does have a bunch of wildly interesting characters. Dumbledore and Snape are definitely among them. But above them all rises Tom Riddle.That being said, Dumbledore was by far my favourite character at the end of the fifth book, and he remains so at the end of the sixth.

It’s all so light-hearted and enjoyable, then we hit Goblet of Fire and from then on Rowling is just tightening her grip on our hearts and bringing the FEELS. This one in particular crushes me. I remember on my first read I was just so freakin’ SHOOK by the events towards the end. I’d love to say it’s easier when you know what’s coming, but it isn’t!!I’ve seen complaints that nothing really happens in this book, but that’s almost what I love about it. It’s the build-up to the big finale, we’re learning about Voldemort’s backstory, we’re introduced to horcruxes... the fun is in the learning and the story progression!And I simply adore that moment when Ron *sorry, WonWon* tells Hermione he loves her (yes it’s in a friendly manner but it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside) I honestly don’t even know if I fully ship Ron and Hermione, it’s conflicting for me - I think she could do better - but I still love this moment. And also when Ginny and Hermione have a little spat and both were quite sassy with each other.. I love it! However, I do not love how inferior Ginny is in the movies compared to Ginny in the books. RUDE.I feel like my Harry Potter reviews are just word vomit! “I LOVED THIS. I hated that. This was so good.” and so forth... but I feel like Harry Potter just makes my brain go into overdrive and my excitement takes over. Apologies.Love Half-Blood Prince. It definitely ranks very high for me in the series! 5 stars!

***Please note that this review may contain spoilers for the overall series, not just this book.***I listened to the bulk of this book while I did some spring cleaning. It kept me company while I sorted through piles of books, moved furniture around, wiped down walls and shelves and vacuumed behind the heavy items that I only move twice a year. It took most of the day and by evening I was putting things back in their places, arms and back sore, crying quietly to myself as Dumbledore drank that potion. I'm sure it would have looked rather ridiculous if anyone had seen me! Once again I was blown away by Stephen Fry's reading. I've reached a point now where I feel like his voice is more familiar to me than those of people I actually know. I'm quite sad that there is only one left, but I also can't wait to start it. There was a particular sense of sadness to this one, knowing that it is the last year where they are students at Hogwarts, though the trio themselves don't know it yet. I drank in every detail of day-to-day student life --- lessons, Quidditch, Peeves, the Fat Lady.  The first time I read the book I was completely floored by Harry's decision to not come back. There is something so heartbreaking about him having to leave behind the place he considers home a year early. The thought of Harry Potter without Hogwarts was incomprehensible. I had so been looking forward to their final year, and suddenly things had veered off completely. I still think it was brilliant of J.K. Rowling to do that. The Felix Felicis chapter remains one of my favourites. I thought they did a great job with this in the film too, with Daniel Radcliffe demonstrating a talent for comedy that I hadn't anticipated, but as ever, in the book there is just so much more time to expand on things. Although I have always remembered that so much was cut away for the films, it's sometimes surprising to be reminded of just how much was left out. Ginny in the movies is... fine, and I think the actress did a good job with a small amount of screen time. But book Ginny is dynamic, smart, funny, talented -- a much better match for Harry, and I think their relationship works better in the books, makes more sense.  Also, while Ron still treats Hermione pretty poorly here, there is more nuance to it. In the films it's like a lot of his redeeming qualities have been stripped away, and he is dumbed down a lot too. He's smarter and more complex in the books and I do wish more of that had been kept on screen. It's really Dumbledore though who feels so much more real in the books. I don't really know how to explain it, but there is just something about book Dumbledore that eclipses movie Dumbledore. I do think however, that his death scene in the film was beautifully shot and I pictured it similarly in my head as it happened in the book.  Sirius's death in the last book and Dumbledore's in this one really hit hard. I find myself genuinely missing them, as if they are actual people I have lost. Dumbledore's death is almost unbearable, and that realisation that I actually had faith in Snape, only for him let me down, is still jarring, even though I now know what is revealed in the final book. Actually, knowing the truth about Snape makes everything he has to do in this book even harder to read. It's all so brutal. Also every sliver of information about Tom/Voldemort that we are given is almost uncomfortably fascinating. Why are villains so interesting?! I'm counting down the days until my next Audible credit so I can start Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's going to be strange to not have another one to look forward to and go on with. I felt like that the first time I read the last book. However, the nice thing is I love rereading, and I'm able to do that as many times as I want, whether it's a physical copy or audio.

25/25 (100%) 5 stars. The one about Tommy Riddle's past. After five books where we only got to know that Voldy is a mad, powerful racist, we finally get to know his road there better.  ‘Half-Blood Prince' is really dark. It's the darkest of them up to this point, and that's no suprise: the war has come, even the Ministry has realised that Voldy's back, so there's some really tough stuff happening, although He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named isn't even physically present in this book. Murders and kidnappings everywhere. At least until we get to Hogwarts - because once our heroes get there, they somehow realise they're teenagers, which leads to a mixture of broken hearts, terrible relationships (Won-Won) and love potions.  Also, we see a lot of Dumbledore in this one who's been absent for most of 'Order of the Phoenix', and of course, a lot of Snape, but to me,  the central figures in this book are Harry and Draco.  Draco has been somewhat absent in the books after 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. He was more of an irritating, stupid running gag who got beaten up all the time. Either he was turned into a ferret, or got jinxed in the Hogwarts Express on the way back - no more of that here. Now, Malfoy Junior is a major player in the game, with terrible consequences for anyone else. Ginny steps right into the spotlight, of course. She's grown strong in 'Order', and here she's just the best. Like, ever. By the way, did Ron really kiss Aunt Muriel? Anyway. What else is there? This is the Won-Won book. This is the one with You-No-Poo. This is the one with Harry high on liquid luck. And of course, it's the one with the best sassy Harry in all of the series:  ""You don't have to call me 'sir', professor.""   I mean, come on. The whole class will have told their grandchildren about it. Neville Longbottom probably thinks of that moment every time he tries to create a Patronus. Somewhere, James Potter and Sirius Black went mad about it.Whatever, five stars. ----Dialogue 5Setting 5Characters 5Writing Style 5Plot 5

”I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. “I am with you.”…It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew—and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents—that there was all the difference in the world.At this point, you’ve either read the Harry Potter series, or you’ve deliberately chosen not to read them. Either way, there’s not much to say here. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has a bit more of a leisurely pace than the others in the series, perhaps because a substantial portion of the story is told in flashbacks. Still, some of my favorite scenes in the whole series are in this book. The Unbreakable Vow. Ron on love potion. Jealous Harry. Harry on Felix Felicis. Luna providing Quidditch commentary. Harry finally getting the girl. Everything that happens between The Cave and the Flight of the Prince. There's a lot of set up for the last book in this one, but it's still an entertaining read. The author may have let people down later in her life; people sometimes suck more than you realize at first. But the Harry Potter series is an achievement that will outlast her and all of us. If somehow you've stubbornly refused to read it, you are really missing out.

I will never get over it. Never.One thing that irritates me is the fact that they didn't add all the extra information given in this book about the horcruxes or Voldemort's family etc into the movie! All the little details are so important and really add to the plot! I think that is why these books will always be my favourite, because yes the films are aMAZING but the books just have the little bit more and I will treasure them always...*hugs all my Harry Potter books*

My heart is shattering as I finish this phenomenal book. I was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time I read the series, I was anxious to see if maybe I would be let down. I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series, and still so far is. I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review, and with good reason. The death of Dumbledore is earth shattering, and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly. This book is the darkest, I believe, of the series, as Voldemort's reign begins to take place. The fear, and frustration is eminent throughout every word; however, there is lightheartedness throughout. Delving into Voldemort's past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book. It's incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time. There is so much we learn, and so much more we can guess about him, which is the sign of a great writer. J.K. Rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives. It is impossible to lose interest as you discover more and more of this story. However, the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of Draco Malfoy. This is his story, his book, no matter how many ways one can look at it. He is so complex, very smart, troubled, hurt, confused, misunderstood, but nevertheless, strong in his beliefs. He loves his family and will do anything to protect them. Something that I didn't notice the first time I read the books, which I can see now, is that Draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders, which means that he is skilled in Occlumency. I adore him and it's crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn't know before just by paying attention to detail. This chills me to my core. I connect with him on so many levels, and although this is odd to many people, because they see him as a villain, he is not, and I truly respect him with everything I have. He knows love, perhaps more than even Harry, as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family. He deserves a chance, just like so many others, as there are many layers to his character. There is so much that I can say about him, but I will keep it at that. I will always cherish this story with all my might. This book destroys me in the best possible ways.

School is out for the summer! The last day of school is usually a bittersweet occasion as I look back and see my kids growing up right before my eyes. With the year winding down on top of everything else in the world right now, I found myself overwhelmed and at a loss for what to read next. Then I remembered that in Retro Chapter Chicks we are reading Harry Potter this year, each at our own pace. For better or for worse, Harry and his magical world has been a part of my reading for my entire adult life. When I find myself entering a reading rut or when life gets busy, Harry has been there to offer an escape. An escape into magic is exactly what I needed even with the series growing darker as it nears its completion. Yet, Harry’s problems are not my own, so I return to Hogwarts to get away from the grim realities of life. Harry Potter has turned sixteen and about to enter the sixth year of his magical education. After battling Death Eaters at the Ministry of Magic, the Ministry believes Dumbledore once again and order has been restored in the magical world, at least on the surface. Harry is now “the chosen one,” the one destined to defeat Voldemort once and for all, and the magical world has put its faith in Harry that he can carry the day. That is quite a burden to handle for a sixteen year old who is left without a family once again, his beloved g-dfather Sirius falling in the battle at the ministry. Harry is still in school as well, beginning advanced magical study in his quest to become an auror and having been named Quidditch captain to boot. Dumbledore has told Harry to rely on his two closest friends to get through the task at hand, yet even that is a tall order with teenaged hormones raging at Hogwarts. Defeating Voldemort is as paramount as ever, so Dumbledore takes it upon himself to further Harry’s education and give him the tools to win the battle once and for all. I have always viewed the Half Blood Prince as the call before the storm. Fred and George’s joke shop is standing room only as all wizards look to get a few laughs to escape the grim realities of their own life. Before stepping foot in the joke shop, Harry assists Dumbledore in persuading Professor Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement to teach potions. Slughorn has the ability to transfigure into a sofa and has a penchant for candied pineapple and mulled mead, which he collects from his prized former pupils, known as The Slug Club. One of these students was none other than Harry’s mother Lily Evans, the best potioneer that Slughorn has taught. Harry is primed to be the star attraction of Slughorn’s new Slug Club; despite once being head of Slytherin house and a favorite professor of many current death eaters, Slughorn begrudgingly agrees to return to Hogwarts. His presence lightens the mood in the castle immensely, as Rowling focuses on his lessons at the expense of most others, even though other subjects are equally important. Slughorn introduces his students to love potions, legal brewing of the poly juice potion, and the golden Felix Felicis, a potion that will give the drinker good luck for an entire day. With Slughorn teaching potions instead of Snape, Harry excels in the subject for the first time in his life, propelling him toward his career as an auror. Love plays a large role here, Voldemort overlooking it’s importance and students as well as peripheral characters enjoying varying degrees of romance. Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are engaged to be married, much to chagrin of all the Weasleys. Ron and Hermoine’s feelings for each change daily; knowing how things end up, it is both comical and frustrating to witness how both of them date other people just to aggravate each other. And knowing how things end up, I still much prefer Hermoine and Crumb and Ron with perhaps someone who has not been introduced yet. From book one it was obvious that Ginny and Harry would end up together, and this story arc is in full effect here. Harry, however, does not have much time to act on his feelings as he is too busy trying to save the world. Ginny notes that that is what she loves about him although additional tender moments would have furthered the storyline. The volatile nature of teenaged love shows that nothing is set in stone, setting the stage for a grand finish later. In addition to the love and learning, Dumbledore takes Harry on a trip down pensieve memory lane to try to find out as much about Voldemort as possible prior to doing battle. Other than the memories, Voldemort does not make an appearance in the book. He is biding his time, waiting for Dumbledore’s army to make the first move. Rowling would rather treat her readers to teenage life - dating, studying for NEWTs, apparition lessons, quidditch- than the impending fight against evil. Careful readers know that Voldemort is the heir of Slytherin, and we meet his mother, uncle, and grandfather here. They indeed place importance on the purity of blood and hold true to Slytherin’s heirlooms; Voldemort himself inherited the penchant to place the upmost importance on trophies linking him to the past. Being raised in an orphanage, he lost the ability to love at a young age and entered Hogwarts a broken person. Although he and Harry both view Hogwarts as their true home after growing up without parents, it is there were their paths diverge, as Dumbledore has reminded Harry that choices are more valued than abilities. Harry with the unlimited propensity to love all creatures is on display here to the point where he even feels sorry for a youthful Lord Voldemort. It is love which carries this book that Voldemort has overlooked in his quest toward wizard world domination. It is the same love that Harry and his friends will undoubtedly use to defeat the dark lord. Series changing revelations occur as the book draws to an end, both whose repercussions will be felt in the series’ final installment. Harry Potter provided me with an escape once again. Even though I knew what was coming, I could not resist the urge to read the last four hundred pages in one long day of reading. For me nothing replaces the feeling of immersing myself in a book rather than taking the time to savor it. I have my summer reading list planned out in earnest and it includes one last trip to Harry’s magical world. For the few days I spend reading it, Harry will provide me with a respite relief from the world around me, which is the best I can ask of from a book. 5 + stars all time favorite ✨🧙‍♂️🔮🧙‍♀️✨

It was perfect, and also had me lol'ing throughout the whole thing..eh, mostly. not the end.﻿The school and classes scenes were also amazing, that's weirdly one of the things I love most about these books. Hogwarts just being Hogwarts. If I'm being honest, weirdly again, the Quidditch scenes sometimes ﻿become a little tedious to me sometimes, but I even loved those in this book, they were just so funny. Thankyou Liquid Luck. (﻿﻿that was amazing, hahaha) The Apparition lessons were also a great laugh!J.K. Rowling is brilliant in everything she does; the humour, suspense, mystery... I mean, she even had me guessing and confused even though I've seen the movies a billion times.I loved getting to delve deeper into the motives and life of Voldemort, it was just so interesting to learn about his past, and what makes him such a complex character. As well as seeing the relationships, or lack of, with him and other people.The love aspect of this book, oh the loveeee, was so cute to read about. I mean, between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, how could it not be good? You could really see them growing up throughout this novel, which I also enjoyed.The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore grew even more in this book (which made the ending that much harder) I've always loved reading about the dynamic between those two. Such a bond.Malfoy, well he was such an interesting character in this one, right from the moment when he stepped on Harry's nose *wince*, that was intense. It was so cool to be able to read about the mystery behind this guy, and try to figure him out a bit more. Draco has always fascinated me, which is probably half to do with Tom Felton, let's be real.Snape, uhm, I'm still kinda confused where I stand in regards to if I like or don't like him, at the moment it's a bit of both. I guess the Deathly Hallows will help me out, but I do really enjoy reading about Snape, even if he makes some...questionable decisions.Can't forget to mention Slughorn! He was a great addition to the story, I really enjoyed his character, and all that he brought to the novel.Once again, the friendship between Ron/Harry/Hermione warmed my little heart, and also tore at it a bit over the course of the novel *cough* thanks Lavender *cough*. But they never fail to make me smile. I feel like even though there was still a bit of it, the angst levels were much lower in this one, haha.Also, how can you not love Fred and George? I adore those two, they're like me in twin boy form. All-in-All, this was yet another solid addition to this amazing series, and it's just incredible how much more I'm getting out of the books than the movies, I really didn't expect to learn this much. Admittedly, I didn't even truly know what a Horcrux was until this book...oops.Can't believe it's time for the final journey...

The Half Blood Prince was a journey in itself; a relentless one at that. The last few chapters came as a complete shock to me, as I’m sure they did to everyone. To say I wasn’t ready would be an understatement.Where do I begin? I’m really starting to enjoy the dark turn that this series is taking, especially since The Order of the Phoenix. The entertainment factor is definitely increasing for me now that we’re receiving more information on Voldemort’s past life. While the first couple of books seemed to have their own individual storylines, now that Voldemort is being explored often the plot feels more continuous, as this will surely be important for the rest of the series.I take back everything I said in previous reviews abut Draco growing more malicious each book. This instalment really made me feel for him, especially after discovering the motive behind his actions. He’s still a teenager, and it’s awful what he’s forced to endure.I find as the cast of characters matures and grows older, I can relate to them more and find a better connectivity to the story. This is perhaps why I’ve enjoyed the later books in this series significantly more, as Harry and his friends are further from children. Harry’s emotions are becoming more complex as he ages, which has allowed me to sympathize with him more easily. The romance has definitely become more prominent in this book, though I will admit I don’t care much for any of the canon pairings. (Wolfstar is the only couple I could have cared for if it happened). This being said I don’t disagree with any of the ships, either. I’m definitely more invested in the plot itself which leaves me with little to care for in terms of the characters’ love lives.

“It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.”

The Half Blood Prince was a great penultimate book; I’m really looking forward to the series conclusion! JK Rowling better do her best and deliver a finale worth the while.

Issues:1. Harry doesn’t have to be the greatest wizard of his time but that he peaked in third year with mastering the patronus charm is quite sad. It’s also sad that he doesn’t feel he needs to work at magic. The idea that Harry could have been in Slytherin or Ravenclaw is laughable - he has no drive, and no intellectual curiosity. Draco grasped occulumency in two months in order to guard himself against Snape, an ally. Harry won't do it to protect himself against Voldemort, even though having failed to do so resulted in Sirius' death. Harry doesn't try even when new skills are obviously useful - not with occulmency, not with wordless magic. Harry turns out to be good at a few discrete things - the patronus charm, resisting the imperius curse - but that never extends, kind of like how Ron's chess skills never extend to any type of application in real life.2. I'm not opposed to Sirius' death but I am opposed to how it means nothing in this book. Harry reassesses nothing. Again, we see Draco taking his responsibilities seriously, Draco questioning authority and learning independence, while Harry continues to prioritize quidditch and his chest monster, and follows whatever Dumbledore says even though he knows Dumbledore is keeping things from him once again. (It also is a little annoying that everyone keeps on saying that one should trust Dumbledore's judgment of Snape; Dumbledore didn't realize that a Death Eater was impersonating one of his close friends for a year). It's a little disgusting that the big reveal with Tonks is that she couldn't care less about Sirius; she's upset that Lupin won't marry her. Not a soul cares about Sirius. Mrs. Weasley doesn't even think to speak of Sirius' death when she sees Harry. Given what happens/doesn't happen with Remus as well (he doesn't form any type of familial bond with Harry, has a totally out of the blue romance plot, reveals himself to be a coward, then dies), I think JKR dislikes the idea of messy, non-blood related, non-nuclear families and finds it easier to dispose of these characters, leaving the core characters to marry into the 'real' family (Weasleys). Sirius had to die, and Remus had to fail to step up, so that Harry would be left with neatly marrying into the Weasleys. I feel confident in this view having seen JKR say that Lupin had to die because she decided to let Arthur Weasley (a total nonentity who has no value other than being part of the Weasleys) live. It's easier to kill off these survivors and imagine them all smiling down on Harry in the afterlife than to imagine that they could ever have a place in society.3. Harry/Tom Riddle parallels were unceremoniously dumped. Instead of going with what she already had developed, JKR chose to make TMR a born inbred sociopath with a “bestial” expression who at age 11 says things like “I can make them hurt if I want to.” JKR has also said in an interview that TMR couldn’t feel love because he was born of rape. Why develop the parallels / choices vs abilities theme only to abandon it? And though I understand what she was doing with the pureblood-inbred insanity thing, frankly, no one wants to read that degeneration shit. It's not compelling in a villain.4. Good v bad women. Bellatrix saying she wishes she had children so she could sacrifice them to Voldemort vs Narcissa desperate to save her son; Lily dying to save her son vs Merope dying despite her son. The reconstruction Dumbledore does of Merope’s life based on 80% guesswork could not be more patronizing. Having a scene where two male characters discuss how pathetic a woman was for dying during childbirth is not great.5. Ginny is unbearable. Instead of giving her a character arc that would follow from the previous books (she did become a whole different character in OOTP but there’s little continuity even from OOTP to HBP), she’s become the school’s punk rock princess, developed entirely to be Harry’s gir- trophy wife to the jock king. She’s a cool girl. She'll fight Hermione, her only depicted friend to defend Harry's honour #standbyyourman. She'll accept Harry dumping her to protect her from Voldemort even though she's written as hating being condescended to and patronized. She's whatever Harry needs, whenever Harry needs her. 6. All the love plots in this book involve women losing their powers or control of themselves because they’re in love. Tonks, Merope, Hermione. Pass. Snape has been an incel for decades without any loss of powers.7. Ron is written as a misogynist ass and he and Hermione are fundamentally incompatible. They should have realized that and moved on. Really, they come together to parent Harry. Without that, there's not a lot there.8. Luna becomes Ginny’s pity project. There is a definite shift in Luna’s character from doing her own thing to sad misfit and I think that’s a decidedly negative change. Ginny tells people off for calling Luna names in this book when she was doing the exact same thing a year ago, having at the time known Luna for years.

This is, hands down, my favorite book of the series. I will make no apologies. I will not even really write a proper review, because who doesn't know this book at this point? I will, however, tell you exactly 
why
 this is my favorite book of the series. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore finally decides that it is time to teach Harry everything he knows about Voldemort so that Harry can eventually defeat him. But Dumbledore knows Harry well, and he knows his faults and weaknesses. Enter Harry's two best friends, Ron and Hermione. You guys, this book is about the power of friendship. Tom Riddle has always worked alone, friendless and self-sufficient. He trusts no one and has no sense of obligation, even to his loyal followers. They are disposable. He has no one to tell him that his ideas suck, or that he is going about things the wrong way, or that his ideas 
really really
 suck, and he wouldn't listen to them if he did. In contrast, since Dumbledore understands that Harry's faults and weakness are made up for by his two friends, he encourages Harry to share everything he learns with them. Hermione is exceptionally brilliant and cautious, while Ron is brave and has tons of practical common sense. Hermione and Ron help balance out Harry's often reckless, undisciplined, how-I-feel-at-this-moment-is-all-that-matters brain. They have learned to rely on each other and listen even if they don't always agree. This has created a very strong bond of fierce loyalty, responsibility, and obligation. Even Ron and Hermione's constant skepticism of Harry's ideas throughout this book is an indication of how great this friendship is. As seen in books 1-5, Harry's ideas are sometimes right and sometimes horribly, horribly wrong. These friends don't take ""the chosen one"" at his word. They challenge him and question him. They aren't just along for the ride. They are in it to freaking win it. Together.But how difficult is it when, in a group of 3, person 1 and 2 start falling for each other and person 3 starts falling for the sister of person 1? Ugh, teenage hormones. The friendship and support Harry has always had through all the terrible things and difficult tasks are suddenly at risk. Watching them work this out is cringe-worthy but oh so true.As the book progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that defeating Voldemort will be an exceptionally difficult task. However, it has been emphasized over and over again throughout the entire series that it will take teamwork to rid the world of evil. In The Sorcerer's Stone, none of the 3 by themselves could have made it through each of the tasks leading up to finding the stone. In The Chamber of Secrets, each of them again played an important role in destroying the first horcrux (which didn't die easily, by the way), along with the crucial assistance of a phoenix and a hat. In The Prisoner of Azkaban, what in the world would have happened if any of the 3 had not taken part? In The Goblet of Fire, Harry would have never gotten through the tournament if the others hadn't help him learn the necessary skills. In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry would have died for sure in the Dept of Mysteries without the D.A. And in this book, we find that Dumbledore himself acted rashly with the second horcrux (which also didn't die easily, by the way), and that this man, perhaps the greatest wizard who ever lived, couldn't have retrieved horcrux #3 without a second person being there to help. When Harry realizes what he has to do at the end of the book, Ron and Hermione quickly, calmly, and unselfishly insist that they will leave their families and their education and go with him whether he likes it or not. Harry sets out on this nearly impossible task with no army except his two soulmates, which might give him a fighting chance against a man with an army of evil but no soul.

Just as was the case at the beginning of the theatrical Transformers: the Movie (released in 1986), it was the year 2005. We had learned that Gwen Stefani, contrary to what you may have heard, was not, in fact, a hollaback girl; Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie kind of had crushes on each other based on their smoldering chemistry in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, portending not-so-good things for America’s sweetheart and favorite Friend Jennifer Aniston; and “crunk” was a real word and an actual thing that you could look up in the dictionary.About a week before the highly anticipated July release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, perhaps the biggest book release of all time (well, until Deathly Hallows dropped), the day began like any other. I strolled to work with the sickly sweet smell of baking garbage assaulting me as I rocked out to tunes on my Discman (yes, even then, I was technologically behind the times). I sat at my desk and appeared to work diligently in my capacity as a marketing and sales-type person at a commercial publisher in Manhattan. The day proceeded normally: I pretended to work, the publisher pretended to pay me, and everyone was fine. Then, a colleague in the next cubicle received a call from a contact of hers at Scholastic. The pretext for the call was professional—coordinating distribution of a book that we were handling—but soon moved onto the publishing topic du jour: the forthcoming publication—from Scholastic, of course, of Half-Blood Prince. Here’s the conversation, as I heard it from my end: “You already have a copy?!”Pause.“Wow. Have you already read…you have?”Pause.(view spoiler)[“DUMBLEDORE DIES?!” (hide spoiler)]And that, dear friends, is how I came to know the climactic event of this legendary tome a week before it arrived at my house, and my reaction, and that of other nearby colleagues, can be best summed up by three words that rhyme with “druther plucking brass pole.”That notwithstanding, this remains a poignantly affecting chapter in the saga, one that’s hard to read without simultaneously mourning the fallen and lamenting the lost innocence of characters we’ve watched grow so much. Still, could have used more Fred and George. Then again, so can everything. Except maybe my wedding night. Well, no, even that would have been enhanced by them.

Granted, I have seen all the films prior to reading the series, but I still happen to find the reading experience incredible. This book was filled with so much content about Lord Voldemort, which I happened to find intriguing. I would love to have a Pensieve, that would really come in handy. This novel was necessary as it paves the way for the huge climax to come. I found the chapter about the multiple Horcruxes fascinating and I actually admired the antagonist (Voldemort) for his genius plotting and dedication to pursue Dark Magic. Even though he is evil, you can’t deny that he is a mastermind. The romance was entertaining and comedic which was a good thing since it put all the seriousness on hold for awhile. It’s incredible seeing how much darker the books and films get since Philosopher’s Stone. I thoroughly enjoyed each minute I spent reading this novel and in no way did I feel as if it was dragged out. Every single chapter was essential to the whole Wizarding World. The characters become much more complex in the Half Blood Prince and J.K. Rowling does an outstanding job in developing them. This was such a detailed novel that I will have to revisit once I start the whole series over.

How are we supposed to feel the deep revulsion AND pity for the man if we can't get more screen time for him??? And so I fell BACK on the bandwagon for all those pretty flashbacks.Ah, the trials and tribulations of a fanboy.This is like knowing Frank Herbert's Dune inside and out and then watching the Lynch mindf*** and spending more than 3/4 of the movie filling in all the details that are left unsaid in the film that make the story deeper and more amazing than the acid trip that I was watching.Okay. Maybe the HP6 film wasn't QUITE that bad and there were a lot of brilliant moments that were visual and direct link-ups to the main plot in the HP7 movies, so continuity was preserved very well. Still, the lack of time with Snape's younger cursecrafting self and the lack of all the mystery subplot with Dumbledore, himself, made the end events kind of rushed and confusing within the movie.Not so at all within the book.The book was a real page-turner for me.

Book #6 is a far cry from #1.A big and important step is taken in the The Half-Blood Prince. Rowling shows she is not afraid to kill off her most precious babies. Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, ""Why?!

That...pretty much sums up my thoughts at the moment. 21/12/2016God, I hate Snape. He really is the worst teacher on the planet. ""I want you to perform a non-verbal spell, which you've never done before and I'm going to give you no instructions about how to do that. Go. (Points will be deducted from every house that isn't Slytherin just because I'm a vindictive asshat)""29/12/2015Alternate title: ""Harry Potter and the Year Shit Got Real"". We get so much backstory on Voldemort here, but it's also a year of Harry dealing with incredibly adult concepts and events. He's not only freaking out about school and fighting Voldemort, he's dealing with disappointing his teachers, and having feelings for Ginny, and his best friends CLEARLY having feelings for each other but not being prepared to act on them yet. So he's trapped in a series of incredibly awkward situations while also learning about magic that's way above his current level of understanding. And basically, I just want to hug all of the characters. Except Snape. He can go die in a fire. 23/6/2014Like I said last time around, this is the book where Ginny comes into her own. It's also a book that's a lot more about Malfoy than it is about Harry. I mean, obviously it's told from Harry's perspective so it's still his story. But on rereads, it becomes apparent that Draco is on Struggle Street for the duration of this book. He's shoved into a situation he doesn't want to be in, he's pale and not sleeping, he's ignored by his teachers and constantly reprimanded by his head of house, and he has to resort to Moaning Myrtle for sympathy. In comparison, Harry's year is a walk in the park. ANYWAY. As is always the case, I found new things this time around, but this time the new thing was rather profound: ""Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!"" (Dumbledore to Harry, p. 477) Excuse me while I go and think serious thoughts.2/1/2013I love this book. Like, so much. The ending kills me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. There's so much backstory, so much explanation of WHY Voldemort is the way he is. I must confess, I DO love Deathly Hallows just that little bit more, but I think that's because of the sense of closure we get. This, however, is the book that makes me wish Ginny had been more prevalent in Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix. Because Ginny is freaking AWESOME. She's a total badass, and it sucks that her character spends so much of the series languishing in the background because Harry's too much of a dipshit to notice that she's there. I can understand why some people don't like it - there's a lot of detail, and all the action is crammed into the last fifty or so pages. But at the end of the day, this book serves as a set up to the big finale in Deathly Hallows. And it does so admirably.
